"“Where has my parrot gone?” Amy, Dan’s older sister, exclaimed frantically. It was just after dinner and Amy had returned to her bedroom to feed her parrot only to find the cage open, empty and had a single red feather from her parrot inside it. “Oh no!” She thought, “My parents are not going to let me keep a pet ever again if I don’t find out who did it!” \n Instantaneously, she sprung into action to try and find out who did it. First, she thought that she might not have locked the cage properly due to her carelessness but recalled clearly that she did lock the cage. Then, she started looking around the cage to see if there were any clues left behind by the culprit. Meanwhile, her younger brother had heard her shout. Waves of anxiety swept through him as he was the one who had set the bird free as he was watching and feeding it without his sister’s permission. At the birdcage, Amy found a piece of cloth with red and white stripes on it that looked like it had been torn off a shirt. She pondered whether the cloth could have been torn off the culprit’s shirt when they freed the bird.\n However, she could not rule anyone out yet as everyone in the family all had red and white striped shirts to wear on national day and they all had tears on them due to various accidents that happened. Below the cage, she found a packet of half-empty bird seeds as if someone was feeding the parrot before it escaped and also an overturned stool. She thought that it might have been her brother as he was the only one who needed a stool to unlock the cage but realised that it could not be him as he did not have the key to unlock the cage. \n Amy then thought to check the security camera her parents had installed and noticed that there was a person standing near the cage at around 7 o'clock at night. She zoomed in on the figure and discovered that the person was short and standing near the cage. Although she could not see what he or she was doing, there was a loud squawk soon afterwards as the parrot escaped.\n Then, realisation dawned on Amy as she hurried to the place where she kept the keys and discovered the key was missing and there was only the spare key left. Realising her own brother had done it, she stormed up the stairs furiously and slammed open her brother’s bedroom door. When Amy opened the door, the waves of rage in her was palpable as she accused her brother indignantly, “I knew you let my parrot escape!” “I… I didn't do it!” Dan said shakily. “Yes you did! There was a piece of the cloth that you are wearing now and also a stool which you used to steal my keys!” Amy said angrily. “I am going to tell mom and dad!”\n The anxiety that coursed through Dan like a wave was palpable as he stuttered over his words. He did set the parrot free but only accidentally as he wanted to feed it at least once.\n In the end, Amy’s parents ordered Dan to pay back the money used to buy the parrot out of his own pocket money and apologize to Amy. She forgave him and decided to put this incident aside and let bygones be bygones.\n\n\n ","“Where has my parrot gone?” Amy, Dan’s older sister, exclaimed frantically.

She pondered whether the cloth could have been torn off the culprit’s shirt when they freed the bird.\n However, she could not rule anyone out yet as everyone in the family all had red and white striped shirts to wear on national day and they all had tears on them due to various accidents that happened. Below the cage, she found a packet of half-empty bird seeds as if someone was feeding the parrot before it escaped and also an overturned stool. She thought that it might have been her brother as he was the only one who needed a stool to unlock the cage but realised that it could not be him as he did not have the key to unlock the cage. \n Amy then thought to check the security camera her parents had installed and noticed that there was a person standing near the cage at around 7 o'clock at night.

Although she could not see what he or she was doing, there was a loud squawk soon afterwards as the parrot escaped.\n Then, realisation dawned on Amy as she hurried to the place where she kept the keys and discovered the key was missing and there was only the spare key left.

There was a piece of the cloth that you are wearing now and also a stool which you used to steal my keys!” Amy said angrily. “I am going to tell mom and dad!”\n The anxiety that coursed through Dan like a wave was palpable as he stuttered over his words. He did set the parrot free but only accidentally as he wanted to feed it at least once.\n In the end, Amy’s parents ordered Dan to pay back the money used to buy the parrot out of his own pocket money and apologize to Amy. She forgave him and decided to put this incident aside and let bygones be bygones.\n\n\n ","“Where has my parrot gone?” Amy, Dan’s older sister, exclaimed frantically.

"“Where has my parrot gone?” Amy, Dan’s older sister, exclaimed frantically. It was just after dinner and Amy had returned to her bedroom to feed her parrot only to find the cage open, empty and had a single red feather from her parrot inside it. “Oh no!” She thought, “My parents are not going to let me keep a pet ever again if I don’t find out who did it!” \n Instantaneously, she sprung into action to try and find out who did it. First, she thought that she might not have locked the cage properly due to her carelessness but recalled clearly that she did lock the cage. Then, she started looking around the cage to see if there were any clues left behind by the culprit. Meanwhile, her younger brother had heard her shout. Waves of anxiety swept through him as he was the one who had set the bird free as he was watching and feeding it without his sister’s permission. At the birdcage, Amy found a piece of cloth with red and white stripes on it that looked like it had been torn off a shirt. She pondered whether the cloth could have been torn off the culprit’s shirt when they freed the bird.\n However, she could not rule anyone out yet as everyone in the family all had red and white striped shirts to wear on national day and they all had tears on them due to various accidents that happened. Below the cage, she found a packet of half-empty bird seeds as if someone was feeding the parrot before it escaped and also an overturned stool.

She zoomed in on the figure and discovered that the person was short and standing near the cage. Although she could not see what he or she was doing, there was a loud squawk soon afterwards as the parrot escaped.\n Then, realisation dawned on Amy as she hurried to the place where she kept the keys and discovered the key was missing and there was only the spare key left. Realising her own brother had done it, she stormed up the stairs furiously and slammed open her brother’s bedroom door. When Amy opened the door, the waves of rage in her was palpable as she accused her brother indignantly, “I knew you let my parrot escape!” “I… I didn't do it!” Dan said shakily. “Yes you did!

""But..."" Danny
I tried to interject.
""No 'but'!"" his mother stormed. Danny's mother had ranted and raved about this before. However, this time, I detected the steely tone in her voice. Before long, it spelt doom for me.
Soon, I would be separated from Danny, my optimistic, fun-loving master whom I adored with all my doggy heart. Danny was protesting, tears glazing his eyes. His mother’s voice had now risen to fever pitch. What was I to do? I knew I had tried to behave. Well, except for one thing — I had the habit of chewing things.

 I flattened my body on the floor, laid my head on my paws and whined. I looked at him mournfully. My legs had turned into mush because of the fear that seized my heart.
“I’m taking him for a walk,” Danny muttered, blinking away unshed tears.
Walking beside Danny, birds flew free in the sky and chirped aloud their cheeky calls. It was an idyllic scene.
“Danny!” someone yelled. It was Mother’s close friend. She was out walking with a baby in a pram.
“Hi, Mrs. Deepak!” Danny shouted as he ran up the slope towards her. As she chatted with Danny, she rocked the pram gently to soothe the baby.
Suddenly, my hackles rose with a tingling premonition. 
 A little boy on a bicycle swerved past unsteadily and knocked Mrs. Deepak's arm. She lost her grip on the pram, and it went rolling down the slope with the baby still inside. I caught a glimpse of the look of horror on her face, as if it had been etched on white marble. My canine instincts had proven right. With a loud bark, I bounded forward, jerking the lead out of Danny's hands in that split second. The lead streamed behind me as I raced after the runaway pram. With an extra burst of energy, I shot level with the pram. Snapping my jaws over one side of the handlebar, I dug into the ground with my paws. The pram's momentum dragged me a little, but to my utmost relief, the wheels slowed, then halted entirely. 
Mrs. Deepak rushed over, her trembling hands scooping the unharmed baby from the pram. Danny caught up, breathless, and clipped my lead back on. ""Good boy!"" he panted, ruffling my fur. Mrs. Deepak thanked me with tearful eyes, and I wagged my tail—just another day in the life of a dog who’d finally earned his extra-large biscuit.
 To my utmost relief, it stopped safely. Surprisingly, the baby was gurgling. Running feet pounded up as Mrs. Deepak dashed to pick up her baby, Danny right on her heels. ""Oh, Danny! Your wonderful dog saved my baby!"" Mrs. Deepak repeated, clasping the baby to her bosom. Later, I learned Danny had poured out his woes to her earlier.

My bag thumped against my back as I sprinted towards the main road, where I knew there would be people.\nThen I heard a voice behind me, breathless. “Wait! You dropped this!”\nI stopped in my tracks and spun around. A boy, around my age, was holding my water bottle. I had left it on the bench outside the school gate.
