"\nIn our rapidly developing society, a child's future is often regarded as the top priority of parents. Many parents hope their children have bright and sustainable futures, and this is often only possible when students ace their examinations. As Singapore is a meritocratic society, only the top percentile can attain the best standard of education. As such, parents often push their children to strive for better grades. However, this pursuit would lead to a highly competitive learning environment where, on one hand, students would find themselves in such an overwhelming learning environment, leading to students having excessive stress and mental strain. Likewise, parents may disapprove of such an overly competitive learning environment, fearing that it might promote an unhealthy perception of education. Meanwhile, governments view competition in schools as a way to find and nurture national talent. Similarly, tuition companies may support a competitive education system, as it motivates worrisome parents to seek extra academic support, ultimately boosting their business. While it is clear that unhealthy competition can be harmful to students, a well-managed and positive competitive environment can motivate learners and bring out their full potential. Therefore, when implemented strategically, competition in schools can be beneficial.\n ",,[],claude-sonnet-4-20250514,reverse,"No annotated response found in Claude's first response; Text mismatch: Original and annotated passages differ when tags are removed.

"I have always been afraid of Dobermanns. Their sharp teeth,strong bodies,and dark eyes made them look dangerous.

"“Where has my parrot gone?” Amy, Dan’s older sister, exclaimed frantically. It was just after dinner and Amy had returned to her bedroom to feed her parrot only to find the cage open, empty and had a single red feather from her parrot inside it. “Oh no!” She thought, “My parents are not going to let me keep a pet ever again if I don’t find out who did it!” \n Instantaneously, she sprung into action to try and find out who did it. First, she thought that she might not have locked the cage properly due to her carelessness but recalled clearly that she did lock the cage. Then, she started looking around the cage to see if there were any clues left behind by the culprit. Meanwhile, her younger brother had heard her shout. Waves of anxiety swept through him as he was the one who had set the bird free as he was watching and feeding it without his sister’s permission. At the birdcage, Amy found a piece of cloth with red and white stripes on it that looked like it had been torn off a shirt. She pondered whether the cloth could have been torn off the culprit’s shirt when they freed the bird.\n However, she could not rule anyone out yet as everyone in the family all had red and white striped shirts to wear on national day and they all had tears on them due to various accidents that happened. Below the cage, she found a packet of half-empty bird seeds as if someone was feeding the parrot before it escaped and also an overturned stool. She thought that it might have been her brother as he was the only one who needed a stool to unlock the cage but realised that it could not be him as he did not have the key to unlock the cage. \n Amy then thought to check the security camera her parents had installed and noticed that there was a person standing near the cage at around 7 o'clock at night. She zoomed in on the figure and discovered that the person was short and standing near the cage. Although she could not see what he or she was doing, there was a loud squawk soon afterwards as the parrot escaped.\n Then, realisation dawned on Amy as she hurried to the place where she kept the keys and discovered the key was missing and there was only the spare key left. Realising her own brother had done it, she stormed up the stairs furiously and slammed open her brother’s bedroom door. When Amy opened the door, the waves of rage in her was palpable as she accused her brother indignantly, “I knew you let my parrot escape!” “I… I didn't do it!” Dan said shakily. “Yes you did! There was a piece of the cloth that you are wearing now and also a stool which you used to steal my keys!” Amy said angrily. “I am going to tell mom and dad!”\n The anxiety that coursed through Dan like a wave was palpable as he stuttered over his words. He did set the parrot free but only accidentally as he wanted to feed it at least once.\n In the end, Amy’s parents ordered Dan to pay back the money used to buy the parrot out of his own pocket money and apologize to Amy. She forgave him and decided to put this incident aside and let bygones be bygones.\n\n\n ",,[],claude-sonnet-4-20250514,reverse,"No annotated response found in Claude's first response; Text mismatch: Original and annotated passages differ when tags are removed.

Realising her own brother had done it, she stormed up the stairs furiously and slammed open her brother’s bedroom door. When Amy opened the door, the waves of rage in her was palpable as she accused her brother indignantly, “I knew you let my parrot escape!” “I… I didn't do it!” Dan said shakily. “Yes you did! There was a piece of the cloth that you are wearing now and also a stool which you used to steal my keys!” Amy said angrily. “I am going to tell mom and dad!”\n The anxiety that coursed through Dan like a wave was palpable as he stuttered over his words. He did set the parrot free but only accidentally as he wanted to feed it at least once.\n In the end, Amy’s parents ordered Dan to pay back the money used to buy the parrot out of his own pocket money and apologize to Amy. She forgave him and decided to put this incident aside and let bygones be bygones.\n\n\n' | Stripped annotated: ''",Claude 4 Sonnet
"“Where has my parrot gone?” Amy, Dan’s older sister, exclaimed frantically. It was just after dinner and Amy had returned to her bedroom to feed her parrot only to find the cage open, empty and had a single red feather from her parrot inside it. “Oh no!” She thought, “My parents are not going to let me keep a pet ever again if I don’t find out who did it!” \n Instantaneously, she sprung into action to try and find out who did it. First, she thought that she might not have locked the cage properly due to her carelessness but recalled clearly that she did lock the cage. Then, she started looking around the cage to see if there were any clues left behind by the culprit. Meanwhile, her younger brother had heard her shout. Waves of anxiety swept through him as he was the one who had set the bird free as he was watching and feeding it without his sister’s permission. At the birdcage, Amy found a piece of cloth with red and white stripes on it that looked like it had been torn off a shirt. She pondered whether the cloth could have been torn off the culprit’s shirt when they freed the bird.\n However, she could not rule anyone out yet as everyone in the family all had red and white striped shirts to wear on national day and they all had tears on them due to various accidents that happened. Below the cage, she found a packet of half-empty bird seeds as if someone was feeding the parrot before it escaped and also an overturned stool. She thought that it might have been her brother as he was the only one who needed a stool to unlock the cage but realised that it could not be him as he did not have the key to unlock the cage. \n Amy then thought to check the security camera her parents had installed and noticed that there was a person standing near the cage at around 7 o'clock at night. She zoomed in on the figure and discovered that the person was short and standing near the cage.

对家庭而言，沟通更是必不可少。现今社会生活节奏快，很多人早出晚归，终日忙碌，很少和家人沟通，以致与家人的关系渐渐疏远。比如，我们常常看到这样的情景：父亲工作一天回到家，累得只想刷手机放松，孩子想分享学校的趣事，却只得到父亲心不在焉的回应；或者母亲忙于家务，孩子几次想帮忙或倾诉烦恼，都被母亲以“别捣乱”或“等一下再说”打发掉。一次两次或许没什么，但长此以往，孩子会觉得父母并不关心自己的生活和感受，便渐渐不再主动与父母交流。父母也可能因不了解孩子的内心世界，在教育上产生误解和冲突。其实，即使亲如家人，也需要经常交流。这样一来，孩子会更体恤父母的辛劳，父母会更了解孩子的心思，家庭氛围也会因此变得更加融洽。,,[],claude-sonnet-4-20250514,reverse,No annotated response found in Claude's first response; Text mismatch: Original and annotated passages differ when tags are removed.

"**A Fearful Encounter**\nIt was already past 8 p.m. when my CCA finally ended. The sky was an inky blue, and the streetlights cast long, flickering shadows on the pavement. My bag felt heavy on my shoulders, and the usually familiar walk home seemed eerily quiet. I was the last one to leave school, and the silence made my footsteps sound louder than usual.\nAs I turned down the narrow lane that led to my block, I suddenly heard it — footsteps. Slow. Deliberate. Just behind me.\nAt first, I thought it was my imagination. I quickened my pace slightly, and the footsteps did too. A chill ran down my spine. I dared not look back. My heart began to pound, and my breaths came faster.\n*Who could it be? Why were they following me?* \nI reached into my pocket for my phone, but my hands were trembling. The footsteps grew louder, quicker. I turned a sharp corner and broke into a run. My bag thumped against my back as I sprinted towards the main road, where I knew there would be people.\nThen I heard a voice behind me, breathless. “Wait! You dropped this!”\nI stopped in my tracks and spun around. A boy, around my age, was holding my water bottle. I had left it on the bench outside the school gate. His eyes widened in alarm, realizing he had frightened me.\n“I’m so sorry!” he said, holding up both hands in surrender. “I didn’t mean to scare you—I just wanted to return this.”\nRelief flooded through me, mixed with embarrassment. I took the bottle and mumbled a thank you, still catching my breath. The fear that had gripped me moments ago faded, replaced by laughter — nervous, but genuine.\nIt was a fearful encounter, yes — but also a reminder that sometimes, our minds can turn shadows into monsters.\n\n\n ",,[],claude-sonnet-4-20250514,reverse,"No annotated response found in Claude's first response; Text mismatch: Original and annotated passages differ when tags are removed.
