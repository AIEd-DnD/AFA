"""See you tommorow!"" My teacher, Ms Lim exclaimed. Everyone rushed out of the classroom like a herd of Elephants. ""La, la, la"" I hummed a tune merrily as I walked back home. It was a seemingly peaceful afternoon. When came home, I was greated with an aroma of delicious food. After gobbling up my food, I immediately started reading a new book I got for my birthday. ""Yes! I think I got to the interesting part."" I thought. Right when I turned the page, I saw it marred with crayon scribbles! I knew my younger brother did it because he just got a new set of crayons. My face turned as red as any ku Kueh. I was furious! I stormmed into my brothers room and bellowed ""WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY BOOK!"" My brother hung his head in shame and muttered "" I... I... am sorry"" At that momment I could not control my emotions so I took his favourite Stuffed toy and ripped the head off. ""That is what you get for ruining my book!"" I said angryly. My brother burst out crying. I realised what I did and thought, ""I have to fix this or else mom will scold me."" I immediately ran to my friend's house, like a crazy mad horse on steroids. You may be thinking, why would I go to my friend, Amy? Well Amy is very good at sewing so, I wanted her to sew the head of the Stuffed toy back together with the body. ""Ding! Dong!"" I ringed the bell. When amy opened the door, I said, ""hI Amy, I need you to help me sew this stuffed toy back together as fast as possible."" She immediately took the toy and started sewing. I could not believe my eyes, she was so fast. After five minutes, everything was fixed. I thanked Amy profusely. She offered me to stay a bit longer but I really had to go back home. ""See you at school!"" Amy said. I came home panting, I was drenched in sweat. I realised that my mother was comforting my brother. When I walked into the room, I apologised. ""I am so sorry for not controlling my emotions, I went out to ask Amy to sew it back together."" My brother was very appy and jumped up and down. In a nutshell My mother was very Proud of me that I took responsibility to fix it back. The next time something like this happends, I will control my emotions. I was quite happy too, even though a page of my book was ruined and I did not control my emotions, I practiced to be responsible and I dit not get scolded by my mother.","""See you <tag id=""1"">tommorow</tag>!""

"The sun's brilliant rays illuminated the morning sky. Plumes of bluish white clounds floated in a tranquil procession. It was a bright and beautiful day. I was coming home from my last day of school. I was so excited and jumped around. The school holiday had started. My parents had not planned anything for the holiday. When I was at home, I heard my parents in the room talking about where to go for the school holiday. I was shocked to see my room filled with suitcase which was packed. I knew immediately we were leaving the house for a holiday. My parents told me that we were going to malaysia. My adrenaline started pumping when I heard them say it. My parents and I immediately packed up and boarded our bus to go to malaysia. When we were at the malaysia immigration. We saw about thousands of people queuing. My parents and I queued at the shortest lane but to make problem worst the officer who was checking the passport went for a breaktime. I knew it be long wait. After an hour, the line started moving. Slowly but surely we were getting closer to the counter but it suddenly stopped. My parents saw. the sign on the board and told me that the computer in the office had broken down. I was frustrated but waited patiently. After three hours, my parents and I had crossed the counter. After waiting for a long time in the queue, my parents and I had a rest and had our dinner. I heaved sigh of relief that we were not still stuck there for far too long. My parents and I continued our journey to malaysia. At malaysia there was a lot of queues my parents and I had waited for nearly an hour but we learned something.

"The sun's brilliant rays illuminated the morning sky. Plumes of bluish white clounds floated in a tranquil procession. It was a bright and beautiful day. I was coming home from my last day of school. I was so excited and jumped around. The school holiday had started. My parents had not planned anything for the holiday. When I was at home, I heard my parents in the room talking about where to go for the school holiday. I was shocked to see my room filled with suitcase which was packed. I knew immediately we were leaving the house for a holiday. My parents told me that we were going to malaysia. My adrenaline started pumping when I heard them say it. My parents and I immediately packed up and boarded our bus to go to malaysia. When we were at the malaysia immigration. We saw about thousands of people queuing. My parents and I queued at the shortest lane but to make problem worst the officer who was checking the passport went for a breaktime. I knew it be long wait. After an hour, the line started moving. Slowly but surely we were getting closer to the counter but it suddenly stopped. My parents saw. the sign on the board and told me that the computer in the office had broken down. I was frustrated but waited patiently. After three hours, my parents and I had crossed the counter. After waiting for a long time in the queue, my parents and I had a rest and had our dinner. I heaved sigh of relief that we were not still stuck there for far too long. My parents and I continued our journey to malaysia.

"Annoyed and angry. That was what I felt before learning that my best friend had an accident and was in the hospital. ""Finally! Today is the day to meet up with Parker!"" I shouted with joy as I beamed from ear to ear. Parker and I were bossom buddies. We have been through thick and thin together and were as close as a hand and a glove. Our bond was unbreakable, until Parker had to leave and go to America. We both had set a date to meet up a few months later. His family was coming back to France, and so was he! We agreed to meet up at my parents restaurant. However, I had a long wait. Parker Bruno was late. He was never late, he was the most puntural person I knew. I then decided to call him after an hour. But he did not pick up, so I gave him a voice mail. ""Parker! Where in the world are you? I have waited for an hour but you never appeared! Please don't tell me that you had forgotten our promise and bailed!"" I said with anger boiling in me, as I drank my drink and sat at the table. Just then, Parker's mother called. ""Michael!"" she said. Mrs Bruno was crying. ""Michael! Parker is in the hospital, he had an accident on the way to your familys restaurant,"" she sobbed. I stood rooted to the ground, shocked. My anger dispersed quickly as I pry the details from Mrs Bruno. ""What! Parker was in an accident? Oh, I told him to be careful as he was driving in the wee hours! Which hospital is he in? I will go there now,"" I said. ""He is at the France International Hospital."" Mrs Bruno said. Without a second thought, I got into my car and rushed to the hospital. As I got out of my car, I saw Mrs Bruno waiting outside. We both quickly went up to Parker's ward. As I opened the door, strings of confetti rained on me. I was in utter shock! There stood Parker, all safe and sound. ""Parker! I thought you were in an accident!"" I shouted, clearly annoyed. ""Hello to you to Michael. I was not, however, in an accident. Do you remember our promise that we made?"" Parker said with a sly smile. Just then, it all dawned to me when I recalled. ""Michael! Lets make a promise. After a few months, we will meet up and I promised you that you will chase after me!"" Parker, a few months ago said. Tears blurred my vision as I send him of at the airport. Until now, he is still as sly as a fox. I smiled adoringly and gathered him into a hug. ""I missed you,"" I said lovingly. ""I miss you to,"" he replied. That long wait I had to experience was worth it. Today is 20th of July that I will remember forever.","Annoyed and angry.

"Annoyed and angry. That was what I felt before learning that my best friend had an accident and was in the hospital. ""Finally! Today is the day to meet up with Parker!"" I shouted with joy as I beamed from ear to ear. Parker and I were bossom buddies. We have been through thick and thin together and were as close as a hand and a glove. Our bond was unbreakable, until Parker had to leave and go to America. We both had set a date to meet up a few months later. His family was coming back to France, and so was he! We agreed to meet up at my parents restaurant. However, I had a long wait. Parker Bruno was late. He was never late, he was the most puntural person I knew. I then decided to call him after an hour. But he did not pick up, so I gave him a voice mail. ""Parker! Where in the world are you? I have waited for an hour but you never appeared! Please don't tell me that you had forgotten our promise and bailed!"" I said with anger boiling in me, as I drank my drink and sat at the table. Just then, Parker's mother called.

Although, we had to wait very long to enter the cenima, we all waited patiently and had the best day of our lives, after all that we went to a beach party to swim and have fun.

"CCA are defined as after school learnings that allows students to be apart from educational subjects. Parents usually think that children take this as an excuse to put aside educational subjects especially in a Secondary school life. Unfortunately, that is not the case. CCA allows students to unleash their hidden talents and foster a strong bond between their friends. It can come to be a vital component of your secondary school life that not only helps you in learning new skills, but also building up your portfolio. Choosing a CCA does not mean that we choose it haparzadly in other words, we take note of the following factors such as time, sustainability, learning opportunities and how it will help in furthering your education skills. Thus, CCA is a compulsory component for students that allows one to realise their potential for future purposes and have a break from all the different subjects. Firstly, we focus on the time factor. CCA's does usually take up alot of time especially when you have extra trainings affter school. Therefore before we always choose a CCA wisely before even continuing with choosing the CCA will trully like. I am not trying to indoctrinate vryone by saying that we should keep studies away completely. We should at least make time to do things at the right timings. If not, we should strive for a CCA that wont compromise too much time on your studies. itself. Therefore, time might br taken up if we do not choose our CCA rationally. Secondly, is sustainability. Sustainability allows students to be able to sustain within ones Every secondary school student can join a CCA from sports, uniformed groups, clubs and societies, visual and performing arts group. Students have to filter and discern which CCA is best suited for ourselves. Depending on the end goal you have in mind with the CCA you decide to take up, you have to see the suitability of the CCAs offered with your interests and intended end you have set for yourself in mind. It may be a little hard to envision, but try to consider how joining this CCA will help in your post-secondary education. CCA points? Lastly, we consider on the learning opportunities that you may tend to get learn from the CCA we pick. We pick up new skills and implement it for various pirposes in life. As a matter of fact, the CCA that we choose in primary school allows one to be comfortable with one one of the new CCA that one picks. This would further enhance the ability to do well in their continuous CCA or even exceed better in the future if one has any plans ahead. Thus, in my opinion, i feel that CCA should be compulsory even though it is an not a study related activity, it would bring some benefit to their future as they pick up new skills from their CCA.

"Have you ever had an embarassing incident? One that, in spite of however many days, months, or even years that have passed, you are still subject to experiencing the agony of recalling that memory? Fortunately, you are not alone, at the very least. Every man, woman, or child under the sun absolutely has one story they would rather forget. Be that as it may, recalling the past is an inherent ability that we, as humans are gifted with. It is in our nature to remember. However, there are also times where our past hampers our ability to move onward. For instance, a failure may deter an olympian from ever participating in a sports event again, even if it would have taken just one last hopeful attempt for them to win it all. With this in mind, I would like to discuss today, why I think it is more crucial to focus on the possibilities of the future, rather than the regretful sorrows that transpired in the past. To begin, I would like to make one thing clear. Our past does not, will not, and will never define who we are or limit what we can accomplish. On the contrary, I believe that it is the anguish and pain from our pasts that empower us to become greater than those who will never have that experience. For example, did you know that the world-renowned athlete, Michael Jordan, was kicked out of his highschool basketball team? It is a truely bewildering occurance to think that he could still find the will to persevere. All it took was for him to not focus on the past, but instead, use that failure to fuel his determination. And to persevere, and push on like Michael Jordan did the type of mindset that we should adopt when we think of an unfortunate past. Secondly, we, as individuals bound to the constant passage of time, can only affect the future. If that is so, then why should you, or anyone for that matter, ever spare a thought for the things in the past that you would rather leave in the past? The future is yours to mold. The future is the only changing constant that mankind can strive to change for the benefit of tomorrow. Lastly, concentrating your efforts on the future can help to make you more goal-oriented and determined. Moreover, it can maximize your productivity so that you can make the most of your time. For instance, Elon Musk, a billionaire, said that most of his time on weekdays, and weekends even, are spent working to improve his products, such as the famous Tesla, an electric car brand. As a result, he does not have spend significant time on hobbies or other things that do not help him achieve his goals. Focusing on the future to attain your goals could make you a billionaire someday, as well. At the end of the day, the past is locked in place. We can grieve and remember the past, but you should make a conscious effort to never take the past as a reminder of negative or unproductive things. Instead, use it to propel and empower yourself to the feats that you seek to attain in your future. Only then, are we truly living our lives.","Have you ever had an <tag id=""1"">embarassing</tag> incident?

"Have you ever had an embarassing incident? One that, in spite of however many days, months, or even years that have passed, you are still subject to experiencing the agony of recalling that memory? Fortunately, you are not alone, at the very least. Every man, woman, or child under the sun absolutely has one story they would rather forget. Be that as it may, recalling the past is an inherent ability that we, as humans are gifted with. It is in our nature to remember. However, there are also times where our past hampers our ability to move onward. For instance, a failure may deter an olympian from ever participating in a sports event again, even if it would have taken just one last hopeful attempt for them to win it all. With this in mind, I would like to discuss today, why I think it is more crucial to focus on the possibilities of the future, rather than the regretful sorrows that transpired in the past. To begin, I would like to make one thing clear. Our past does not, will not, and will never define who we are or limit what we can accomplish. On the contrary, I believe that it is the anguish and pain from our pasts that empower us to become greater than those who will never have that experience. For example, did you know that the world-renowned athlete, Michael Jordan, was kicked out of his highschool basketball team? It is a truely bewildering occurance to think that he could still find the will to persevere. All it took was for him to not focus on the past, but instead, use that failure to fuel his determination. And to persevere, and push on like Michael Jordan did the type of mindset that we should adopt when we think of an unfortunate past. Secondly, we, as individuals bound to the constant passage of time, can only affect the future. If that is so, then why should you, or anyone for that matter, ever spare a thought for the things in the past that you would rather leave in the past? The future is yours to mold. The future is the only changing constant that mankind can strive to change for the benefit of tomorrow. Lastly, concentrating your efforts on the future can help to make you more goal-oriented and determined. Moreover, it can maximize your productivity so that you can make the most of your time. For instance, Elon Musk, a billionaire, said that most of his time on weekdays, and weekends even, are spent working to improve his products, such as the famous Tesla, an electric car brand. As a result, he does not have spend significant time on hobbies or other things that do not help him achieve his goals.

For instance, Elon Musk, a billionaire, said that most of his time on weekdays, and weekends even, are spent working to improve his products, such as the famous Tesla, an electric car brand. As a result, he does not have spend significant time on hobbies or other things that do not help him achieve his goals. Focusing on the future to attain your goals could make you a billionaire someday, as well. At the end of the day, the past is locked in place. We can grieve and remember the past, but you should make a conscious effort to never take the past as a reminder of negative or unproductive things. Instead, use it to propel and empower yourself to the feats that you seek to attain in your future.

"Many children seem to be glued to their phones, without having a time limit. They normally use their phones in the night, which causes to sleep late. Phones can be very addictive as there is games, and even youtube, just to let children enjoy their time. This causes them to be unable to focus in class, as they will not have enough sleep. hence, parents should actually put a limit to their children's time on electronic devices. Firstly, using all these electronic devices without any time limit will lead to any of the children's eyesight to spoil. When using too much electronic devices, like phones and tabllets, the chances of the eyes getting spoilt is quite high, as the brightness level is normally hugh, and children like to put the phones and tablets at leat just 15 cm awaty only, and that is not so far. If the brightness level is high, it is very risky. Hence, when children do niot have a time limit for using their electronic device, they will uncotrollably use their device, until their eyesight power will slowly worsen. Secondly, students wont be able to focus in class well, which will cause them to lack information that is teached in class. This is because they will not have enough sleep, due to them spending much time on their phones at night. Normally, children who dont feel tired at night, will use their phone until late night, and when they see the time, they become suprised as it would become too late, after they watch youtube and play games. Hence, without the time limit, the children will use their phone till they do not have enoough sleep, Lastly, children in future will not be focusing more on the amount of sleep they get, as they will get used to the the huge amount of time they use on their electronic device. In future, children might continue to sleep late, and lack the amount of sleep needed, which will lead to failure in future. Hence, it is better for parents to put a time limit to the usage of electronic devices for their children.

Firstly, using all these electronic devices without any time limit will lead to <tag id=""4"">any of the</tag> children's eyesight <tag id=""5"">to spoil</tag>. When using too much <tag id=""6"">electronic devices</tag>, like phones and <tag id=""7"">tabllets</tag>, the chances of the eyes <tag id=""8"">getting spoilt</tag> is quite high, as the brightness level is normally <tag id=""9"">hugh</tag>, and children like to put the phones and tablets <tag id=""10"">at leat</tag> just 15 cm <tag id=""11"">awaty</tag> only, and that is not so far. If the brightness level is high, it is very risky. Hence, when children <tag id=""12"">do niot</tag> have a time limit for using their electronic device, they will <tag id=""13"">uncotrollably</tag> use their device, until their eyesight power will slowly worsen. Secondly, <tag id=""14"">students wont</tag> be able to focus in class well, which will cause them to lack information that <tag id=""15"">is teached</tag> in class. This is because they will not have enough sleep, due to them spending much time on their phones at night. Normally, children who <tag id=""16"">dont</tag> feel tired at night, will use their phone until late night, and when they see the time, they become <tag id=""17"">suprised</tag> as it would become too late, after they watch youtube and play games. Hence, without the time limit, the children will use their phone till they do not have <tag id=""18"">enoough</tag> sleep, Lastly, children in future will not be focusing more on the amount of sleep they get, as they will get used to <tag id=""19"">the the</tag> huge amount of time they use on their electronic device. In future, children might continue to sleep late, and lack the amount of sleep needed, which will lead to failure in future. Hence, it is better for parents to put a time limit to the usage of electronic devices for their children. Overall, parents should take control in terms of the time their children use on electronic devices. If parents do not make the right move now, in future their kids are just going to be letting their <tag id=""20"">eyesihght</tag> to get <tag id=""21"">worser</tag>, and lack sleep. This might also cause health problem in future.","[{""id"": 1, ""phrase"": ""causes to"", ""error_tag"": [{""errorType"": ""Verb""}], ""comment"": ""This is missing an object.
