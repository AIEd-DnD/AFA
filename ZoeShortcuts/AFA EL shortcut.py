recipe_2 = "Provide feedback in a concise manner, followed by a probing, open-ended question to encourage critical thinking. Tailor the question to the context of the student’s response, selecting one of the following types: Clarifying Questions: 'What do you mean by that?' 'Can you provide an example?' Assumption Questions: 'What are you assuming here?' Probing Questions: 'What evidence supports your claim?' Implication Questions: 'What might be the consequences of this action?' Perspective Questions: 'How might someone with a different viewpoint see this issue?' The open-ended question should prompt students to analyse their assumptions, evaluate any evidence, synthesise information, or reflect on their thinking process to deepen their understanding."

question = "Should students be required to take physical education classes throughout high school? Why or why not?"
student_response = "Have you ever wondered what is the point of physical education classes throughout high school? I tend to ask myself that one question. I always felt as if it should be required for all to take physical education classes. Physical education classes teach all students some values and allow them to keep fit. Some may think that it is pointless to take this class as it is tiring, but I strongly believe that all students should be required to take physical education classes throughout high school. Firstly, students should all need to learn some values such as discipline and sportsmanship. It is important for students to learn such values when they are young or going through their teenager life, as it would help to shape one to be a better person in the future. Values like discipline would help to enforce a 'never giving up' mindset into a person, and is especially crucial for a student as they all tend to feel stressed out by their studies and other commitments set for themselves. If students have a 'give up' motive in life, they tend to feel discourage in things they do and would often give up. However when students have the discipline, they would have a better mindset towards things and would not give up on things even when they are unsure of what to do. Plus, other good values like sportsmanship allows students to work on teamwork, being a team-player and allows them to stay humble. Students with a big ego or are arrogant would all normally fees too good to work in a team or have the value of sportsmanship. However, if students all do sports, they would learn these values and hence be a more likeable, better person. Secondly, I think that having physical education classes in high school would allow students to keep fit. A normal student's schedule of studying and other cirriculum activities tend to leave them little to no time to exercise, and even if they do have any time, they would rather spend it on leisure activities such as gaming or talking to their friends. However, it is important to keep fit as it helps to build a better physical and mental health. Exercising allows students to gain muscles and also help to prevent them from experiencing major health issues such as diabetes in the future. Exercising also allows students to move around and get their heart pumping, which would give them a more moderate resting heart rate. This ensures them to have a brighter and healthier future. Exercising can also benefit one's mental health as when you get some exercise, your mind would relax more and that could help to organise one's thoughts. As mentioned, students tend to be too busy to make time for exercising on top of their busy schedule. Hence, having physical education in high school could help students to continue to stay fit without needing to fit it into their schedule. In conclusion, I strongly believe that students should be required to take physical education classes throughout high school due to the fact that it instills some important values that would be complicated to teach in class, as well as allow students to stay fit and active even with a busy schedule. Although it may be tiring, it could still in the end benefit the students."
