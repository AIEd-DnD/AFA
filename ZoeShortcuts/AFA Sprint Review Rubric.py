Tailor the question to the context of the student’s response, selecting one of the following types: Clarifying Questions: 'What do you mean by that?' 'Can you provide an example?' Assumption Questions: 'What are you assuming here?' Probing Questions: 'What evidence supports your claim?' Implication Questions: 'What might be the consequences of this action?' Perspective Questions: 'How might someone with a different viewpoint see this issue?' The open-ended question should prompt students to analyse their assumptions, evaluate any evidence, synthesise information, or reflect on their thinking process to deepen their understanding."

student_response = "One day me and my friends Max, Tom and Sally and my teacher were cleaning our class room because it was too dirty we broght brooms, rags and pails we were all working together and my teacher was also helping by wiping the whiteboard and I was wiping the tables. While I was cleaning the table, Max though it was funny to disturb me and he used the broom and poked me in the stomach and I accidentally knocked over the pail of water. When the pail of water spilled all over the floor our teacher rushed over immediately our teacher looked tarrified and very angry. Our teacher was very angry at us for playing a fool in class and she punish us. The next day when we saw our teacher we went up to her a told our teacher that we are very sorry for what we have done and told her we learned our lesson not to play in class and not disturbed each other."
student_sec_response="Have you ever thought about the role of physical education classes in high school? It's a question that often cross my mind. While some people argue that these classes are essential, I find myself pondering whether they truly matter. After all, there are so many subjects to focus on, and physical education seems just one of many. Firstly, the idea of learning values like discipline and sportsmanship is often bring up. But have you ever considered how many different types of sports there is? Some students might prefer soccer, while others might enjoy basketball or even chess. It’s quite fascinates how diverse interests can be! Speaking of diversity, did you know that there are over 7,000 languages spoken around the world? That’s a lot of communication styles! Moreover, physical education is said to help students stay fit. But let’s be honest—many students have their own ways of exercising outside of school. Some might prefer going for a run or playing sports with friends rather than participating in organized classes. And who can blame them? With busy schedules filled with homework and extracurricular activities, students might not even see the need for structured exercise. They could be spending their free time on hobbies they enjoy instead. For example, some students might be really into video games or collecting stamps, which can be just as engaging as any sport! Additionally, we often hear that exercise promotes better mental health. While that’s true to some extent, it seem a bit simplistic to suggest that just having physical education classes will solve all mental health issues. Students have various coping mechanisms and support systems outside of school that play significant roles in their well-being. Speaking of support systems, have you ever thought about how important pets can be for emotional support? Many people find comfort in their furry friends!In conclusion, the debate over whether students should be required to take physical education classes throughout high school is quite complex. While there are arguments in favor of it, such as learning values and maintaining fitness, there are also valid points against it. Ultimately, it may come down to personal preference and individual circumstances rather than a blanket requirement for all students. And on a completely different note, isn’t it interesting how many different types of fruit exist? There is so many flavors to explore!"
