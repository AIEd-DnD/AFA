One day me and my friends Max, Tom and Sally and my teacher were cleaning our class room because it was too dirty we broght along brooms, rags and pails we were all working together and my teacher was also helping by wiping the whiteboard and I was wiping the tables. While I was cleaning the table, Max though it was funny to disturb me and he used the broom and poked me in the stomach and I accidentally knocked over the pail of water. When the pail of water spilled all over the floor our teacher rushed over immediately our teacher looked tarrifiad and very angry. Our teacher was very angry at us for playing a fool in the class and she punish us. The next day when we saw our teacher we went up to her a told our teacher that we are very sorry for what we have done and told her we learned our lessen not to play in class and not disturbed each other.
