Ring, ring, ring the school bell rang, me and my friend Alex were discussing about the class meetup after graduation. "I was pondering about what we will do during the meetup, we could go shopping or even have lunch together!" I told Alex as he was the organiser for the meetup. "I think we should'nt do too much we may get too tired and is too early to think about it, focus on your studies." When I reached home, I realised that the meetup was in 2 months after that, I focused on my studies and I graduated, after a few weeks went by as per normal, I waited and waited till the day has come when we discussed in a group chat to meet up at a near by restruant. I waited for hours when nobody showed up and I left, when I got up from my chair my friend Alex had just arrived and asked me why I was so early to the meet up. I was shocked when he told me that the meet up will start at 3 p.m. instead of 8 a.m., I told him that I had read wrongly and had ran to the restruant at 7.30 a.m. He laughed at me saying "next time read before you do anything and clarify if you don't understand". when all my other classmates had arrived we started to shop then we were shocked when Alex's mother had bought 36 tickets to the new Avengers movie we watched it and was so thankful to Alex's mother for buying us tickets to the movies. Although, we had to wait very long to enter the cenima, we all waited patiently and had the best day of our lives, after all that we went to a beach party to swim and have fun. We all went home after that, It was the best and most memeroble day of our lives.
