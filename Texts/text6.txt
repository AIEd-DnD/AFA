One fine school day, Mrs brook and her students are cleaning the class for PSLE day as all the P6 Students are writteing their exam. As Mrs brook and mary were wiping the whiteboard and Tom cleaning the table and Jack Swiping the floor, they were all working together Tom and his naughty friend Jack started playing a fool as Mrs brook was busy with mary. AS Tom was playing Jack pocked Tom to hard and he did't see the pail behind him, when Jack pocked Tom he accidentally knocked over the pail of water onto the ground. When the pail hit the ground it made a loud bang Mrs brook was horrified when she heard the loud bang She rushed over immediately to see what had happen. When she saw what had happen she was raging mad she punished the pupils for behaving like that. Mrs brook make them write "I will not misbehave again" 20 times after they were done cleaning the class. Mrs brook called both their parents and their parents were disapointed of their action and the grounded they realised how misbehaving is a big mistake and they never misbehave in clas ever again.
