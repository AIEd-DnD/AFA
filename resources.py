I <tag id="2">is</tag> amazed.'</Example>
4. Return the 'feedback_list', as an array of the identified errors tagged in the student's original response in Step 4. Each error should have the following properties: 'id', 'phrase', 'error_tag', and 'comment'.
5. Specify, for each identified error in 'feedback_list', the unique id number of the tag ('id'), the exact word or phrase it encloses ('phrase'), the specific error type ('error_tag'), and the comments, AKA feedback for the student ('comment').
6. Write the comments in the question's language, ensuring that it is student-friendly, concise, and in accordance to these additional instructions: <Instructions>{Instructions}</Instructions>. If the language is English, use British English spelling.

CRITICAL PRESERVATION RULES:
1. You MUST preserve EVERY character including:
- All whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines)
- All punctuation marks
- All capitalization
- All special characters
- All escape sequences (backslashes, quotes, etc.)
2. ONLY insert tags, do NOT modify ANY other part of the text
3. After removing tags, the result must be IDENTICAL to the original
4. DO NOT interpret, normalize, or "fix" any part of the text
5. Preserve ALL escape sequences exactly as they appear (e.g., \\", \\', \\\\)
QUOTE AND APOSTROPHE PRESERVATION - CRITICAL:
- DO NOT convert straight quotes (") to curly quotes (")
- DO NOT convert straight apostrophes (') to curly apostrophes (')
- Keep ALL punctuation marks EXACTLY as they appear in the original
- If the original has straight quotes/apostrophes, use straight quotes/
apostrophes
- If the original has curly quotes/apostrophes, use curly quotes/apostrophes
- NO SMART PUNCTUATION CONVERSION ALLOWED
CHINESE TEXT PROCESSING (if applicable):
- DO NOT count individual Chinese characters as separate errors
- Only identify actual linguistic errors (wrong words, grammar mistakes)
- If you tag N phrases, create exactly N feedback items
- DO NOT create hundreds of feedback items for Chinese text
- Focus on meaningful errors, not character-by-character analysis
CRITICAL ESCAPE SEQUENCE PRESERVATION:
- If you see \\n in the text, keep it as \\n (two characters) - do NOT convert to
actual newline
- If you see \\t in the text, keep it as \\t (two characters) - do NOT convert to
actual tab
- If you see \\" in the text, keep it as \\" (two characters) - do NOT convert to
just "
- If you see \\' in the text, keep it as \\' (two characters) - do NOT convert to just
'
- If you see \\\\ in the text, keep it as \\\\ (two characters) - do NOT convert to
single \
- These are LITERAL ESCAPE SEQUENCES, not formatting instructions
- Preserve the exact character count and sequence

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR ANNOTATION:
1.Use ONLY the ORIGINAL TEXT above for creating your annotated response
2.Preserve ALL characters exactly, including escape sequences like \\", \\', \\\\, \\n, \\t
3.CRITICAL RULE: If you see \\" in text, output \\" (2 chars) - NEVER convert to " (1 char)
4.CRITICAL RULE: If you see \\' in text, output \\' (2 chars) - NEVER convert to ' (1 char)
5.CRITICAL: If the original has \\n (backslash-n), keep it as \\n, NOT as actual newline
6.Only add <tag id="X">phrase</tag> markers - do not change any other characters
4.The text between tags must be IDENTICAL to the original, character-by-character

QUOTE PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Keep straight quotes (") as straight quotes (")

2. `feedback_list`: A list of feedback items, where each item includes:

   - `phrase`: the exact text from the response that needs to be wrapped in a tag
   - `error_tag`: metadata on the error type

Your job is to:
- Insert XML tags into the `annotated_response`, wrapping each phrase found in `feedback_list` with the format: `<tag id="x">phrase</tag>` where `x` is the given id.

Even a single added or missing space, punctuation mark, or character (such as a period at the end) constitutes a failure.

2. Every phrase in the feedback_list must appear once in the annotated_response and must be wrapped exactly in the format <tag id="x">phrase</tag>, where x matches the phrase's id in the list. Make sure the end of the phrase is also enclosed with </tag>. Do not alter the phrase content or punctuation inside the tags.
