      "reasoning_summary": "**Planning Lesson Structure**\n\nI need to create a lesson plan with three sections, each intended to contain three activities, though we won't list those activities just yet. The sections should include headings with clear learning objectives, descriptions, teacher notes, and a connection to KAT. For the lesson description, I'll keep it concise—just 1-5 sentences. I'll include \"Embed scaffolding\" as it’s a required KAT. Then, I’ll consider adding “Support assessment for learning” or “Facilitate learning together” for further depth.",
      "generated_content": "LESSON DESCRIPTION:  \nStudents will explore the causes, experiences and lasting impact of the Japanese occupation of Singapore through primary sources, guided inquiry and collaborative reflection. They will analyse wartime documents and personal accounts to understand daily life under occupation and evaluate its legacy on Singapore’s development. Scaffolded prompts and structured group tasks will support students at every stage, while peer discussion fosters deeper comprehension. By the end of the lesson, students will articulate informed perspectives on the occupation’s significance and relate historical lessons to contemporary society.\n\nRECOMMENDED KEY APPLICATIONS OF TECHNOLOGY (KAT):  \n1. Embed scaffolding – Interactive hints, guided question prompts and tiered support will help students navigate complex historical narratives and source analysis.  \n2. Facilitate learning together – Digital collaboration tools and structured group tasks will allow students to co-construct understanding, share insights and learn from peers.\n\nLESSON SECTIONS:\n\nSection 1: Setting the Stage – Prelude to Occupation  \n- Learning Objectives:  \n  • Identify key events leading up to the fall of Singapore in February 1942  \n  • Place the Japanese occupation within the wider context of World War II in Asia  \n  • Recall major military and political developments that precipitated the occupation  \n- Description:  \n  Students build a foundational timeline of events before, during and immediately after the British surrender, establishing context for deeper exploration.  \n- Teacher Notes:  \n  • Use a collaborative timeline tool with built-in prompts at each date;  \n  • Pose guiding questions (“What strategic factors made Singapore vulnerable?”) and reveal hints as needed;  \n  • Encourage students to share prior knowledge before introducing new content.  \n- KAT Connection:  \n  • Embed scaffolding through clickable hints at each timeline event;  \n  • Facilitate learning together by having students add and comment on peers’ timeline entries.\n\nSection 2: Voices from Occupation – Source Analysis and Empathy  \n- Learning Objectives:  \n  • Analyse primary sources (diary excerpts, propaganda posters, oral testimonies) for perspective and bias  \n  • Interpret the lived experiences of soldiers, civilians and internees during the occupation  \n  • Compare different types of evidence to build a multifaceted historical narrative  \n- Description:  \n  In small groups, students examine curated digital artifacts, respond to structured prompts and develop a collective interpretation of daily life under Japanese rule.  \n- Teacher Notes:  \n  • Provide graphic organizers with question prompts for each source;  \n  • Circulate among groups to offer targeted scaffolds (e.g., vocabulary help, contextual clues);  \n  • Ask groups to present one surprising finding to the class.  \n- KAT Connection:  \n  • Embed scaffolding via source-specific question banks and glossaries;  \n  • Facilitate learning together by assigning rotating roles (analyst, presenter, recorder) for peer accountability.\n\nSection 3: Reflection and Legacy – Learning from the Past  \n- Learning Objectives:  \n  • Evaluate the short- and long-term social, economic and political impacts of the occupation on Singapore  \n  • Reflect on how historical memory shapes national identity and civic responsibility  \n  • Synthesize findings into personal or group reflections that connect past lessons to present issues  \n- Description:  \n  Students engage in a structured forum to debate how the occupation influenced post-war policies and collective memory, then craft individual reflections on its relevance today.  \n- Teacher Notes:  \n  • Use a digital discussion board with prompt scaffolds (“Which occupation policy had the greatest impact?”);  \n  • Provide a reflection template with guiding questions for students to personalise their responses;  \n  • Conclude with a plenary where volunteers share insights.  \n- KAT Connection:  \n  • Embed scaffolding through tiered reflection prompts and sentence starters;  \n  • Facilitate learning together via an online debate format and peer feedback on reflections."

    "step_2_activities": {
      "reasoning_summary": "**Selecting SLS Tools**\n\nThe user wants nine activities with specific structures. First, I need to pick up to four unique SLS tools, focusing on collaboration and scaffolding. I think Tooltip, Discussion Board, Embed Google Docs, and Subgroups would work well. Tooltip can offer embedded hints, Discussion Board facilitates class debates, Embed Google Docs supports collaboration, and Subgroups encourage small tasks. Alternatively, I could consider Interactive Thinking Tool instead of Subgroups, but I’ll finalize on these four for now.",
      "generated_content": "SELECTED SLS TOOLS FOR THIS LESSON:\n1. Tooltip – Provides embedded, context-sensitive hints and guiding questions to scaffold student understanding of complex historical sources.\n2. Embed Google Docs – Enables real-time collaborative construction of timelines, source analyses and group reflections, supporting co-creation of knowledge.\n3. Discussion Board – Hosts structured forums and debates where students post arguments, respond to peers and build collective insights on legacy issues.\n4. Subgroups – Organizes students into stable small teams for guided inquiry, role-based source analysis and peer accountability.\n\nRECOMMENDED KEY APPLICATIONS OF TECHNOLOGY (KAT):\n1.
