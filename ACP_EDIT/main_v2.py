Within each module, there can be multiple sections to break up the lesson. Each section consists of activities for students to attempt during the lesson. And each activity comprises of various components (text/media, MCQ/MRQ, Discussion Question, Poll, Free Response Question), which students would interact with during the lesson.</Context>

        IMPORTANT: You must create EXACTLY {lesson_details['num_sections']} sections, and each section will later have EXACTLY {lesson_details['max_activities']} activities.

        First, recommend 2 Key Applications of Technology (KAT) from the following list that are most relevant to the topic and objectives of the lesson: Foster conceptual change; Support assessment for learning; Facilitate learning together; Develop metacognition; Provide differentiation; Embed scaffolding; Enable personalization; Increase motivation.

        Your output should only be rich text, do not include hyperlinks, code snippets, mathematical formulas or xml.

        Structure your response as follows:

        **RECOMMENDED KEY APPLICATIONS OF TECHNOLOGY (KAT):**
