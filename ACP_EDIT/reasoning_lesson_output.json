      "generated_content": "**LESSON OVERVIEW:**  \nStudents embark on an exploratory journey into poetic techniques, beginning with collaborative analysis of imagery and figurative language, advancing to sound devices and structural patterns, and culminating in the creative application of these techniques in their own writing. Throughout, learners engage in active discussion, peer teaching and digital collaboration to build a shared understanding. Metacognitive prompts encourage students to monitor their thinking, articulate strategy use and set personal learning goals. The lesson balances teacher scaffolding with student-driven inquiry, fostering both skill mastery and reflective growth.\n\n**RECOMMENDED KEY APPLICATIONS OF TECHNOLOGY (KAT):**  \n1. Facilitate learning together – Digital platforms will enable real-time collaboration on poem annotations, peer feedback and group brainstorming. By working in virtual breakout rooms and shared whiteboards, students co-construct understanding of poetic devices, leveraging each other’s insights and promoting social knowledge building.  \n2. Develop metacognition – Online journals and reflective surveys prompt learners to articulate which strategies helped them identify and use poetic techniques. Regular self-assessment checkpoints encourage goal setting, strategy evaluation and adjustment, strengthening students’ awareness of their own thinking processes.\n\n**PEDAGOGICAL APPROACH:**  \nAn active-learning, constructivist strategy guides the lesson, weaving whole-class discussion, small-group inquiry and individual reflection. Interaction patterns include think-pair-share, jigsaw analysis of different poems and peer teaching. Learning progresses from teacher-guided exploration to student-driven creation, with metacognitive pauses after each segment to consolidate understanding and plan next steps.\n\n**HIGH-LEVEL SECTION BREAKDOWN:**  \n\nSection 1: Exploring Imagery and Figurative Language  \n- Main Learning Focus: Recognise and interpret similes, metaphors and personification.  \n- Pedagogical Strategy: Begin with a collaborative annotation of a poem in small groups, followed by group presentations.  \n- KAT Implementation: Use a shared digital whiteboard for collective annotation (Facilitate learning together); prompt students to jot down “I noticed… I wondered…” reflections in an online journal (Develop metacognition).\n\nSection 2: Unpacking Sound Devices and Structure  \n- Main Learning Focus: Identify alliteration, assonance, rhyme scheme and stanzaic form.  \n- Pedagogical Strategy: Rotate students through expert-groups, each focusing on one device, then reconvene for peer teaching.  \n- KAT Implementation: Provide templates in a collaborative document for experts to build mini-lessons (Facilitate learning together); include metacognitive checklists for experts to self-evaluate clarity and pacing (Develop metacognition).\n\nSection 3: Crafting and Reflecting on Poetic Technique  \n- Main Learning Focus: Apply learned techniques to compose a short poem.  \n- Pedagogical Strategy: Students draft independently, then engage in structured peer review and revision.  \n- KAT Implementation: Host poems in a shared portfolio space for peer comments (Facilitate learning together); integrate a guided reflection form where students map technique choice to intended effect (Develop metacognition).\n\n**ASSESSMENT STRATEGY:**  \nFormative assessment is ongoing: teacher circulates during group work to probe understanding, digital polls gauge confidence with each technique, and peer feedback is structured around clear rubrics. Metacognitive journal entries serve as self-assessment artifacts. An exit ticket asks students to name one technique they mastered and one strategy they will adjust, informing subsequent lesson planning.\n\n**POTENTIAL SLS TOOLS RECOMMENDATION:**  \n- Padlet for collaborative poem annotation and idea mapping  \n- Google Docs (or Sheets) for expert-group lesson planning and peer review  \n- Flipgrid for oral reflections on strategy use and technique choices  \n- Kahoot! for quick formative quizzes on terminology and device identification",

      "reasoning_summary": "**Structuring lesson sections**\n\nThe user wants me to create three detailed lesson sections, each with a specific structure. Each section is supposed to have a title, learning objectives, a description, a pedagogical approach, teacher notes, and a KAT connection. Even though the user didn't specify the two activities for each section right now, it seems logical to plan for them since they mentioned each section would later include two activities. I'll focus on structuring the sections effectively!",
      "generated_content": "**LESSON DESCRIPTION:**  \nStudents will explore key poetic techniques—imagery, figurative language, sound devices and structure—through collaborative analysis, expert-led peer teaching and creative composition. Using the SLS Annotation Canvas and Shared Whiteboard, they will co-construct meaning, identify devices in model poems and articulate their interpretations. Expert-group jigsaws will deepen understanding of alliteration, assonance, rhyme and stanzaic form. Finally, learners will draft and refine their own poems in the SLS Collaborative Document, give structured peer feedback and reflect on strategy use in their Digital Journals. Metacognitive prompts at each stage will help students monitor their thinking, set goals and adjust strategies for deeper learning.\n\n**CONFIRMED KEY APPLICATIONS OF TECHNOLOGY (KAT):**  \n1. Facilitate learning together – via SLS Annotation Canvas, Shared Whiteboard, Collaborative Document and Shared Portfolio  \n2.
