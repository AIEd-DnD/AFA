Through active learning and collaboration, students will engage in analyzing and creating poetry while developing their critical thinking and metacognitive skills. The session is designed to foster creativity, encourage feedback amongst peers, and help students appreciate the nuances of poetic expression.\n\n**RECOMMENDED KEY APPLICATIONS OF TECHNOLOGY (KAT):**\n\n1. **Facilitate learning together** - This KAT is essential as it emphasizes collaborative learning, enabling students to engage in discussions and peer feedback, crucial for understanding poetic techniques. Implemented through group activities, students will use shared online platforms to collaboratively analyze poems and compose their own, making the learning experience interactive and community-oriented.\n\n2. **Develop metacognition** - Encouraging students to think about their own learning processes will help them gain deeper insights into the poetic techniques they employ. This will be implemented through reflective journals and discussions where students articulate their thought processes and creative decisions when analyzing or writing poetry, fostering self-awareness in their learning journey.\n\n**PEDAGOGICAL APPROACH:**\nThe overall pedagogical strategy combines direct instruction and experiential learning methods. Initially, the teacher will introduce poetic techniques through mini-lessons, followed by hands-on exploration via group activities. Students will engage in peer discussions and reflections, promoting a diverse range of perspectives as they analyze poems. Interaction patterns will include whole-class discussions, small group collaboration, and individual reflections, ensuring a comprehensive learning experience progressing from understanding to creation.\n\n**HIGH-LEVEL SECTION BREAKDOWN:**\n\n**Section 1: Understanding Poetic Techniques**\n- **Main Learning Focus:** Students will learn to identify and analyze various poetic techniques such as metaphor, simile, imagery, and alliteration.\n- **Pedagogical Strategy:** Initiate with a teacher-led discussion and exemplars from well-known poems, followed by guided group analysis of selected poetry.\n- **KAT Implementation:** Facilitate learning together by collaborating on shared documents for analysis and peer commentary.\n\n**Section 2: Creating Poetry with Techniques**\n- **Main Learning Focus:** Students will apply the learned techniques to craft their own poems.\n- **Pedagogical Strategy:** Workshop format where students brainstorm ideas, draft their poems, and work in pairs to offer feedback and suggestions for improvement.\n- **KAT Implementation:** Develop metacognition by having students maintain a reflective journal documenting their creative process and decisions.\n\n**Section 3: Sharing and Reflecting on Poetry**\n- **Main Learning Focus:** Students will share their poems and reflect on the application of poetic techniques and the feedback received.\n- **Pedagogical Strategy:** Peer sharing sessions to create a supportive environment for constructive criticism, followed by a class discussion to evaluate the effectiveness of different techniques.\n- **KAT Implementation:** Facilitate learning together by encouraging students to engage in meaningful discussions about each other's work, enhancing comprehension of poetic elements through varied perspectives.\n\n**ASSESSMENT STRATEGY:**\nStudent learning will be monitored through formative assessments including peer feedback during group activities and completion of reflective journals. Additionally, the final assessment will include a self-evaluation rubric for their poems, where students will articulate the techniques used and the effectiveness of their poetic expression, ensuring accountability and deeper learning.\n\n**POTENTIAL SLS TOOLS RECOMMENDATION:**\n1. Google Docs for collaborative poem analysis and feedback \n2. Padlet for shared reflections and discussions \n3. Seesaw for students’ portfolio showcasing their poetry \n4. Grammarly for feedback on their poetic drafts, focusing on language and style",
