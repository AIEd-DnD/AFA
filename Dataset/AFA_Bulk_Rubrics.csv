我开始拼命的复习，做了很多试题，甚至放弃了和朋友们一起玩的时间。可是，复习的时候，我开始变得不耐烦，看到小华做的题目总是很轻松，我就觉得自己不如他。于是，我开始不喜欢和他一起讨论问题，觉得他总是能轻松答对那些我做错的题目。我们之间的关戏变得越来越冷淡，我甚至开始怀义他是不是有什么不正当的手段。 
 
 
终于，竞赛来了。我紧张得不得了，手心里全是汗。虽然我尽力发挥，但最终还是没能超越小华。我很失望，觉得自己付出的努力没有得到回报。我看到小华得了第一名，虽然他看起来很开心，但我心里有种不太舒服的感觉，因为我觉得自己和他竞争时太过用力，失去了很多友谊和快乐。 
 
 
从这件事中，我意识到虽然竞争可以让我们变得更好，但过度的竞争有时会让我们失去更多东西，比如朋友之间的信任和关戏。如果我们只想着急败别人，而忽视了与他人合作和互相帮助的意义，那么这种竞争就变得没有意义，反而会带来不好的后果。以后我会更加主重和同学们一起合作，而不是只故着抄越别人。 我一直认为竞争是非常重要的，它能让我们变得更，取得更好的成绩。最近，我遇到了一次竞赛，它让我意识到恶性竞争有时也能带来不好的后果。有一天，我们班举行了一场英语比赛，很多同学都很紧张，因为这次比赛很重要，能影响到我们的成绩。我的同学小华非常历害，他总是考试得第一，大家都觉得他是最聪明的。我也很想超越他，赢得第一名。我开始拼命的复习，做了很多试题，甚至放弃了和朋友们一起玩的时间。可是，复习的时候，我开始变得不耐烦，看到小华做的题目总是很轻松，我就觉得自己不如他。于是，我开始不喜欢和他一起讨论问题，觉得他总是能轻松答对那些我做错的题目。我们之间的关戏变得越来越冷淡，我甚至开始怀义他是不是有什么不正当的手段。终于，竞赛来了。我紧张得不得了，手心里全是汗。虽然我尽力发挥，但最终还是没能超越小华。我很失望，觉得自己付出的努力没有得到回报。我看到小华得了第一名，虽然他看起来很开心，但我心里有种不太舒服的感觉，因为我觉得自己和他竞争时太过用力，失去了很多友谊和快乐。从这件事中，我意识到虽然竞争可以让我们变得更好，但过度的竞争有时会让我们失去更多东西，比如朋友之间的信任和关戏。如果我们只想着急败别人，而忽视了与他人合作和互相帮助的意义，那么这种竞争就变得没有意义，反而会带来不好的后果。以后我会更加主重和同学们一起合作，而不是只故着抄越别人。",,"内容 - 5 - 内容不足，不切合题意。内容层次不清楚，没有条理或重复，甚至杂乱无章。, 内容 - 4 - 内容不太充实，不太切合题意。内容层次不太清楚，说明也不太详尽、不太有条理。, 内容 - 3 - 内容还算充实，还算切合题意。内容还算有层次，说明还算详尽、有条理。, 内容 - 2 - 内容相当充实，相当切合题意。内容相当有层次，说明相当详尽，也相当有条理。, 内容 - 1 - 内容充实，切合题意。内容有层次，说明详尽、有条理。, 语文与结构 - 5 - 语句不通顺，汉字的书写、词语、语法及标点符号的运用错误非常多。词汇贫乏，遣词造句错误多，表达不清楚。组织凌乱，没有衔接。, 语文与结构 - 4 - 语句不太通顺，汉字的书写、词语、及标点符号的运用错误多。词汇有限，句式简单，没有变化，表达不太清楚。组织不太得当，衔接不太紧凑，段落不太分明。, 语文与结构 - 3 - 语句还算通顺，汉字的书写、词语、语法及标点符号的运用有些错误。用词还算适当，句式简单，变化少，表达还算清楚。组织还算得当，衔接还算紧凑，段落还算分明。, 语文与结构 - 2 - 语句相当通顺，汉字的书写、词语、语法及标点符号的运用有一些小错误。用词适当，句式相当正确且有变化，表达相当清楚。组织相当得当，衔接相当紧凑，段落相当分明。, 语文与结构 - 1 - 语句通顺，汉字的书写、词语、语法及标点符号的运用绝大多数正确。如有错误，也是极小的。用词丰富适当，句式正确且多样化，表达清楚。组织得当，衔接紧凑，段落分明。",,,,,
