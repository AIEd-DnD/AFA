151,English,Primary 6, ,"I used to think that hard work was not necessary and that I could always take shortcuts to achieve my goals. However, one incident changed my mindset forever, teaching me a valuable lesson about perseverance and responsibility.

It all started when my teacher announced that there would be a class mathematics competition. The winner would receive a trophy and a gift voucher. I was thrilled because I had always wanted to be recognised for my achievements. However, instead of practising diligently, I assumed that my natural ability would be enough to win. I only skimmed through a few questions the night before and went to bed early, confident that I would do well.

The next day, I walked into the classroom feeling excited. The competition began, and I was given a set of challenging math problems. As I stared at the questions, my confidence quickly faded. My mind went blank. I realised that I had no idea how to solve most of them. My hands grew clammy, and my heart pounded. I glanced around and saw my classmates deep in thought, solving the problems with ease. At that moment, regret filled me. If only I had prepared properly!

When the results were announced, I did not even make it to the top five. My face burned with embarrassment as my teacher handed the trophy to my best friend, Jason. He had worked tirelessly every day, revising and practising different types of questions. I felt a pang of guilt, knowing that I had taken the competition too lightly.

After school, I congratulated Jason and admitted that I had not put in enough effort. He smiled and said, “Hard work always pays off. You can do better next time if you really try.” His words stuck with me. That day, I made a promise to myself—to never take shortcuts again and to always put in my best effort.

Since then, I have learned the importance of perseverance and responsibility. Success does not come easily; it requires dedication and effort.

I was thrilled because I had always wanted to be recognised for my achievements. However, instead of practising diligently, I assumed that my natural ability would be enough to win. I only skimmed through a few questions the night before and went to bed early, confident that I would do well.

The next day, I walked into the classroom feeling excited. The competition began, and I was given a set of challenging math problems. As I stared at the questions, my confidence quickly faded.

I glanced around and saw my classmates deep in thought, solving the problems with ease. At that moment, regret filled me. If only I had prepared properly!

When the results were announced, I did not even make it to the top five. My face burned with embarrassment as my teacher handed the trophy to my best friend, Jason.

160,English,Primary 6, ,"I used to think that hard work was not necessary and that I could always take shortcuts to achieve my goals. However, one incident changed my mindset forever, teaching me a valuable lesson about perseverance and responsibility.

It all started when my teacher announced that there would be a class mathematics competition. The winner would receive a trophy and a gift voucher. I was thrilled because I had always wanted to be recognised for my achievements. However, instead of practising diligently, I assumed that my natural ability would be enough to win. I only skimmed through a few questions the night before and went to bed early, confident that I would do well.

The next day, I walked into the classroom feeling excited. The competition began, and I was given a set of challenging math problems. As I stared at the questions, my confidence quickly faded. My mind went blank. I realised that I had no idea how to solve most of them. My hands grew clammy, and my heart pounded. I glanced around and saw my classmates deep in thought, solving the problems with ease. At that moment, regret filled me. If only I had prepared properly!

When the results were announced, I did not even make it to the top five. My face burned with embarrassment as my teacher handed the trophy to my best friend, Jason. He had worked tirelessly every day, revising and practising different types of questions. I felt a pang of guilt, knowing that I had taken the competition too lightly.

After school, I congratulated Jason and admitted that I had not put in enough effort. He smiled and said, “Hard work always pays off. You can do better next time if you really try.” His words stuck with me. That day, I made a promise to myself—to never take shortcuts again and to always put in my best effort.

Since then, I have learned the importance of perseverance and responsibility. Success does not come easily; it requires dedication and effort. That competition was a turning point in my life, and I will never forget the lesson it taught me.", , , ,"Adjective - Incorrect or inappropriate use of adjectives, such as using the wrong form (comparative, superlative): Incorrect: ""She is more prettier than her sister.""

161,English,Primary 6, ,"Guilt weighed heavily on me as I replayed the argument in my mind. It had all started with a simple misunderstanding, but it had caused a rift between me and my best friend.

Jake and I had been inseparable since childhood. We did everything together, from playing video games and riding our bicycles around the neighbourhood to staying up late talking about life. He was the one person I could always count on, and I never thought anything could come between us. But one day, something happened that made me question our friendship.

I was walking past the school canteen when I heard laughter coming from a group of students. As I got closer, I recognised Jake’s voice among them. My heart sank when I heard my name being mentioned, followed by more laughter. My stomach twisted. Was he making fun of me? Was he telling jokes at my expense? A surge of anger and betrayal coursed through me.

Without waiting to hear more, I turned on my heel and walked away, my mind spinning. I felt humiliated and hurt. How could he, my best friend, talk about me behind my back? That evening, I could not shake the bitterness that filled me. The next day, I confronted him, my emotions bubbling over like a volcano about to erupt.

“How could you do that to me?” I snapped, my hands clenched into fists.

Jake looked confused. “What are you talking about?”

“Don’t play dumb! I heard you laughing about me with your new friends,” I accused, my voice rising.

His expression changed from confusion to hurt. “I wasn’t making fun of you,” he said, his tone defensive.

But I wasn’t in the mood to listen. Without giving him a chance to explain, I stormed off. Over the next few days, I ignored him completely. I avoided him in class, refused to respond to his texts, and even turned away when he tried to talk to me. I convinced myself that I was right to be angry.

It wasn’t until a few days later that I spoke to another friend about what had happened. He looked surprised and told me that I had completely misunderstood the situation. “Jake wasn’t making fun of you,” he said. “He was actually sharing a funny memory about the time you two got lost during last year’s school camp. Everyone was laughing because it was such a ridiculous story, not because they were mocking you.”

A cold wave of realisation washed over me. I had let my anger cloud my judgment. Instead of talking to Jake and finding out the truth, I had assumed the worst and shut him out. I had hurt someone who had always stood by me.

That evening, I mustered the courage to call him. As the phone rang, my heart pounded. What if he was still upset? What if I had ruined our friendship beyond repair?

When Jake picked up, I took a deep breath. “Jake, I’m so sorry,” I said, my voice trembling. “I should’ve trusted you instead of assuming the worst. I realise now that I jumped to conclusions without even giving you a chance to explain.”

There was a pause, and then he let out a small chuckle. “I was wondering when you’d come to your senses,” he said. “I was pretty hurt, you know. But I forgive you. Next time, talk to me first before deciding I’m the bad guy.”

Relief flooded me. I had been lucky—Jake was a true friend, and he was willing to put this behind us. That day, I learned a valuable lesson about trust and communication. Never assume the worst without hearing the full story. Misunderstandings can break even the strongest friendships if we let emotions take control.

A surge of anger and betrayal coursed through me.

Without waiting to hear more, I turned on my heel and walked away, my mind spinning. I felt humiliated and hurt. How could he, my best friend, talk about me behind my back? That evening, I could not shake the bitterness that filled me. The next day, I confronted him, my emotions bubbling over like a volcano about to erupt.

“How could you do that to me?” I snapped, my hands clenched into fists.

Jake looked confused. “What are you talking about?”

“Don’t play dumb! I heard you laughing about me with your new friends,” I accused, my voice rising.

His expression changed from confusion to hurt. “I wasn’t making fun of you,” he said, his tone defensive.

But I wasn’t in the mood to listen. Without giving him a chance to explain, I stormed off. Over the next few days, I ignored him completely. I avoided him in class, refused to respond to his texts, and even turned away when he tried to talk to me. I convinced myself that I was right to be angry.

It wasn’t until a few days later that I spoke to another friend about what had happened. He looked surprised and told me that I had completely misunderstood the situation. “Jake wasn’t making fun of you,” he said. “He was actually sharing a funny memory about the time you two got lost during last year’s school camp. Everyone was laughing because it was such a ridiculous story, not because they were mocking you.”

A cold wave of realisation washed over me. I had let my anger cloud my judgment. Instead of talking to Jake and finding out the truth, I had assumed the worst and shut him out. I had hurt someone who had always stood by me.

That evening, I mustered the courage to call him. As the phone rang, my heart pounded. What if he was still upset? What if I had ruined our friendship beyond repair?

When Jake picked up, I took a deep breath. “Jake, I’m so sorry,” I said, my voice trembling. “I should’ve trusted you instead of assuming the worst. I realise now that I jumped to conclusions without even giving you a chance to explain.”

There was a pause, and then he let out a small chuckle. “I was wondering when you’d come to your senses,” he said. “I was pretty hurt, you know. But I forgive you. Next time, talk to me first before deciding I’m the bad guy.”

Relief flooded me. I had been lucky—Jake was a true friend, and he was willing to put this behind us. That day, I learned a valuable lesson about trust and communication. Never assume the worst without hearing the full story. Misunderstandings can break even the strongest friendships if we let emotions take control.

My heart sank when I heard my name being mentioned, followed by more laughter. My stomach twisted. Was he making fun of me? Was he telling jokes at my expense? A surge of anger and betrayal coursed through me.

Without waiting to hear more, I turned on my heel and walked away, my mind spinning. I felt humiliated and hurt. How could he, my best friend, talk about me behind my back? That evening, I could not shake the bitterness that filled me. The next day, I confronted him, my emotions bubbling over like a volcano about to erupt.

“How could you do that to me?” I snapped, my hands clenched into fists.

Jake looked confused. “What are you talking about?”

“Don’t play dumb! I heard you laughing about me with your new friends,” I accused, my voice rising.

His expression changed from confusion to hurt. “I wasn’t making fun of you,” he said, his tone defensive.

But I wasn’t in the mood to listen. Without giving him a chance to explain, I stormed off. Over the next few days, I ignored him completely. I avoided him in class, refused to respond to his texts, and even turned away when he tried to talk to me. I convinced myself that I was right to be angry.

It wasn’t until a few days later that I spoke to another friend about what had happened. He looked surprised and told me that I had completely misunderstood the situation. “Jake wasn’t making fun of you,” he said. “He was actually sharing a funny memory about the time you two got lost during last year’s school camp. Everyone was laughing because it was such a ridiculous story, not because they were mocking you.”

A cold wave of realisation washed over me. I had let my anger cloud my judgment. Instead of talking to Jake and finding out the truth, I had assumed the worst and shut him out. I had hurt someone who had always stood by me.

That evening, I mustered the courage to call him. As the phone rang, my heart pounded. What if he was still upset? What if I had ruined our friendship beyond repair?

When Jake picked up, I took a deep breath. “Jake, I’m so sorry,” I said, my voice trembling. “I should’ve trusted you instead of assuming the worst. I realise now that I jumped to conclusions without even giving you a chance to explain.”

There was a pause, and then he let out a small chuckle. “I was wondering when you’d come to your senses,” he said. “I was pretty hurt, you know. But I forgive you. Next time, talk to me first before deciding I’m the bad guy.”

Relief flooded me. I had been lucky—Jake was a true friend, and he was willing to put this behind us. That day, I learned a valuable lesson about trust and communication. Never assume the worst without hearing the full story. Misunderstandings can break even the strongest friendships if we let emotions take control. From that moment on, I promised myself that I would always seek the truth before jumping to conclusions.", ,  , ,"Adjective - Incorrect or inappropriate use of adjectives, such as using the wrong form (comparative, superlative): Incorrect: ""She is more prettier than her sister.""

Hitler exploited this weakness, pushing his foreign policy goals with little fear of retribution.

201,Chinese,Secondary 2,竞争往往会给人带来前进的动力，然而最近发生的一件事，却让你明白恶性竞争会带来不良的结果。试描述这件事，并谈谈你从中得到的启示。,"我一直认为竞争是非常重要的，它能让我们变得更，取得更好的成绩。最近，我遇到了一次竞赛，它让我意识到恶性竞争有时也能带来不好的后果。 
 
 
有一天，我们班举行了一场英语比赛，很多同学都很紧张，因为这次比赛很重要，能影响到我们的成绩。我的同学小华非常历害，他总是考试得第一，大家都觉得他是最聪明的。我也很想超越他，赢得第一名。 
 
 
我开始拼命的复习，做了很多试题，甚至放弃了和朋友们一起玩的时间。可是，复习的时候，我开始变得不耐烦，看到小华做的题目总是很轻松，我就觉得自己不如他。于是，我开始不喜欢和他一起讨论问题，觉得他总是能轻松答对那些我做错的题目。我们之间的关戏变得越来越冷淡，我甚至开始怀义他是不是有什么不正当的手段。 
 
 
终于，竞赛来了。我紧张得不得了，手心里全是汗。虽然我尽力发挥，但最终还是没能超越小华。我很失望，觉得自己付出的努力没有得到回报。我看到小华得了第一名，虽然他看起来很开心，但我心里有种不太舒服的感觉，因为我觉得自己和他竞争时太过用力，失去了很多友谊和快乐。 
 
 
从这件事中，我意识到虽然竞争可以让我们变得更好，但过度的竞争有时会让我们失去更多东西，比如朋友之间的信任和关戏。如果我们只想着急败别人，而忽视了与他人合作和互相帮助的意义，那么这种竞争就变得没有意义，反而会带来不好的后果。以后我会更加主重和同学们一起合作，而不是只故着抄越别人。 我一直认为竞争是非常重要的，它能让我们变得更，取得更好的成绩。最近，我遇到了一次竞赛，它让我意识到恶性竞争有时也能带来不好的后果。有一天，我们班举行了一场英语比赛，很多同学都很紧张，因为这次比赛很重要，能影响到我们的成绩。我的同学小华非常历害，他总是考试得第一，大家都觉得他是最聪明的。我也很想超越他，赢得第一名。我开始拼命的复习，做了很多试题，甚至放弃了和朋友们一起玩的时间。可是，复习的时候，我开始变得不耐烦，看到小华做的题目总是很轻松，我就觉得自己不如他。于是，我开始不喜欢和他一起讨论问题，觉得他总是能轻松答对那些我做错的题目。我们之间的关戏变得越来越冷淡，我甚至开始怀义他是不是有什么不正当的手段。终于，竞赛来了。我紧张得不得了，手心里全是汗。虽然我尽力发挥，但最终还是没能超越小华。我很失望，觉得自己付出的努力没有得到回报。我看到小华得了第一名，虽然他看起来很开心，但我心里有种不太舒服的感觉，因为我觉得自己和他竞争时太过用力，失去了很多友谊和快乐。从这件事中，我意识到虽然竞争可以让我们变得更好，但过度的竞争有时会让我们失去更多东西，比如朋友之间的信任和关戏。如果我们只想着急败别人，而忽视了与他人合作和互相帮助的意义，那么这种竞争就变得没有意义，反而会带来不好的后果。以后我会更加主重和同学们一起合作，而不是只故着抄越别人。",,,"内容 - 5 - 内容不足，不切合题意。内容层次不清楚，没有条理或重复，甚至杂乱无章。, 内容 - 4 - 内容不太充实，不太切合题意。内容层次不太清楚，说明也不太详尽、不太有条理。, 内容 - 3 - 内容还算充实，还算切合题意。内容还算有层次，说明还算详尽、有条理。, 内容 - 2 - 内容相当充实，相当切合题意。内容相当有层次，说明相当详尽，也相当有条理。, 内容 - 1 - 内容充实，切合题意。内容有层次，说明详尽、有条理。, 语文与结构 - 5 - 语句不通顺，汉字的书写、词语、语法及标点符号的运用错误非常多。词汇贫乏，遣词造句错误多，表达不清楚。组织凌乱，没有衔接。, 语文与结构 - 4 - 语句不太通顺，汉字的书写、词语、及标点符号的运用错误多。词汇有限，句式简单，没有变化，表达不太清楚。组织不太得当，衔接不太紧凑，段落不太分明。, 语文与结构 - 3 - 语句还算通顺，汉字的书写、词语、语法及标点符号的运用有些错误。用词还算适当，句式简单，变化少，表达还算清楚。组织还算得当，衔接还算紧凑，段落还算分明。, 语文与结构 - 2 - 语句相当通顺，汉字的书写、词语、语法及标点符号的运用有一些小错误。用词适当，句式相当正确且有变化，表达相当清楚。组织相当得当，衔接相当紧凑，段落相当分明。, 语文与结构 - 1 - 语句通顺，汉字的书写、词语、语法及标点符号的运用绝大多数正确。如有错误，也是极小的。用词丰富适当，句式正确且多样化，表达清楚。组织得当，衔接紧凑，段落分明。",

终于，竞赛来了。我紧张得不得了，手心里全是汗。虽然我尽力发挥，但最终还是没能超越小华。我很失望，觉得自己付出的努力没有得到回报。我看到小华得了第一名，虽然他看起来很开心，但我心里有种不太舒服的感觉，因为我觉得自己和他竞争时太过用力，失去了很多友谊和快乐。 
 
 
从这件事中，我意识到虽然竞争可以让我们变得更好，但过度的竞争有时会让我们失去更多东西，比如朋友之间的信任和关戏。如果我们只想着急败别人，而忽视了与他人合作和互相帮助的意义，那么这种竞争就变得没有意义，反而会带来不好的后果。以后我会更加主重和同学们一起合作，而不是只故着抄越别人。 我一直认为竞争是非常重要的，它能让我们变得更，取得更好的成绩。最近，我遇到了一次竞赛，它让我意识到恶性竞争有时也能带来不好的后果。有一天，我们班举行了一场英语比赛，很多同学都很紧张，因为这次比赛很重要，能影响到我们的成绩。我的同学小华非常历害，他总是考试得第一，大家都觉得他是最聪明的。我也很想超越他，赢得第一名。我开始拼命的复习，做了很多试题，甚至放弃了和朋友们一起玩的时间。可是，复习的时候，我开始变得不耐烦，看到小华做的题目总是很轻松，我就觉得自己不如他。于是，我开始不喜欢和他一起讨论问题，觉得他总是能轻松答对那些我做错的题目。我们之间的关戏变得越来越冷淡，我甚至开始怀义他是不是有什么不正当的手段。终于，竞赛来了。我紧张得不得了，手心里全是汗。虽然我尽力发挥，但最终还是没能超越小华。我很失望，觉得自己付出的努力没有得到回报。我看到小华得了第一名，虽然他看起来很开心，但我心里有种不太舒服的感觉，因为我觉得自己和他竞争时太过用力，失去了很多友谊和快乐。从这件事中，我意识到虽然竞争可以让我们变得更好，但过度的竞争有时会让我们失去更多东西，比如朋友之间的信任和关戏。如果我们只想着急败别人，而忽视了与他人合作和互相帮助的意义，那么这种竞争就变得没有意义，反而会带来不好的后果。以后我会更加主重和同学们一起合作，而不是只故着抄越别人。",,,"内容 - 5 - 内容不足，不切合题意。内容层次不清楚，没有条理或重复，甚至杂乱无章。, 内容 - 4 - 内容不太充实，不太切合题意。内容层次不太清楚，说明也不太详尽、不太有条理。, 内容 - 3 - 内容还算充实，还算切合题意。内容还算有层次，说明还算详尽、有条理。, 内容 - 2 - 内容相当充实，相当切合题意。内容相当有层次，说明相当详尽，也相当有条理。, 内容 - 1 - 内容充实，切合题意。内容有层次，说明详尽、有条理。, 语文与结构 - 5 - 语句不通顺，汉字的书写、词语、语法及标点符号的运用错误非常多。词汇贫乏，遣词造句错误多，表达不清楚。组织凌乱，没有衔接。, 语文与结构 - 4 - 语句不太通顺，汉字的书写、词语、及标点符号的运用错误多。词汇有限，句式简单，没有变化，表达不太清楚。组织不太得当，衔接不太紧凑，段落不太分明。, 语文与结构 - 3 - 语句还算通顺，汉字的书写、词语、语法及标点符号的运用有些错误。用词还算适当，句式简单，变化少，表达还算清楚。组织还算得当，衔接还算紧凑，段落还算分明。, 语文与结构 - 2 - 语句相当通顺，汉字的书写、词语、语法及标点符号的运用有一些小错误。用词适当，句式相当正确且有变化，表达相当清楚。组织相当得当，衔接相当紧凑，段落相当分明。, 语文与结构 - 1 - 语句通顺，汉字的书写、词语、语法及标点符号的运用绝大多数正确。如有错误，也是极小的。用词丰富适当，句式正确且多样化，表达清楚。组织得当，衔接紧凑，段落分明。",

从这件事中，我意识到虽然竞争可以让我们变得更好，但过度的竞争有时会让我们失去更多东西，比如朋友之间的信任和关戏。如果我们只想着急败别人，而忽视了与他人合作和互相帮助的意义，那么这种竞争就变得没有意义，反而会带来不好的后果。以后我会更加主重和同学们一起合作，而不是只故着抄越别人。 我一直认为竞争是非常重要的，它能让我们变得更，取得更好的成绩。最近，我遇到了一次竞赛，它让我意识到恶性竞争有时也能带来不好的后果。有一天，我们班举行了一场英语比赛，很多同学都很紧张，因为这次比赛很重要，能影响到我们的成绩。我的同学小华非常历害，他总是考试得第一，大家都觉得他是最聪明的。我也很想超越他，赢得第一名。我开始拼命的复习，做了很多试题，甚至放弃了和朋友们一起玩的时间。可是，复习的时候，我开始变得不耐烦，看到小华做的题目总是很轻松，我就觉得自己不如他。于是，我开始不喜欢和他一起讨论问题，觉得他总是能轻松答对那些我做错的题目。我们之间的关戏变得越来越冷淡，我甚至开始怀义他是不是有什么不正当的手段。终于，竞赛来了。我紧张得不得了，手心里全是汗。虽然我尽力发挥，但最终还是没能超越小华。我很失望，觉得自己付出的努力没有得到回报。我看到小华得了第一名，虽然他看起来很开心，但我心里有种不太舒服的感觉，因为我觉得自己和他竞争时太过用力，失去了很多友谊和快乐。从这件事中，我意识到虽然竞争可以让我们变得更好，但过度的竞争有时会让我们失去更多东西，比如朋友之间的信任和关戏。如果我们只想着急败别人，而忽视了与他人合作和互相帮助的意义，那么这种竞争就变得没有意义，反而会带来不好的后果。以后我会更加主重和同学们一起合作，而不是只故着抄越别人。",,,"内容 - 5 - 内容不足，不切合题意。内容层次不清楚，没有条理或重复，甚至杂乱无章。, 内容 - 4 - 内容不太充实，不太切合题意。内容层次不太清楚，说明也不太详尽、不太有条理。, 内容 - 3 - 内容还算充实，还算切合题意。内容还算有层次，说明还算详尽、有条理。, 内容 - 2 - 内容相当充实，相当切合题意。内容相当有层次，说明相当详尽，也相当有条理。, 内容 - 1 - 内容充实，切合题意。内容有层次，说明详尽、有条理。, 语文与结构 - 5 - 语句不通顺，汉字的书写、词语、语法及标点符号的运用错误非常多。词汇贫乏，遣词造句错误多，表达不清楚。组织凌乱，没有衔接。, 语文与结构 - 4 - 语句不太通顺，汉字的书写、词语、及标点符号的运用错误多。词汇有限，句式简单，没有变化，表达不太清楚。组织不太得当，衔接不太紧凑，段落不太分明。, 语文与结构 - 3 - 语句还算通顺，汉字的书写、词语、语法及标点符号的运用有些错误。用词还算适当，句式简单，变化少，表达还算清楚。组织还算得当，衔接还算紧凑，段落还算分明。, 语文与结构 - 2 - 语句相当通顺，汉字的书写、词语、语法及标点符号的运用有一些小错误。用词适当，句式相当正确且有变化，表达相当清楚。组织相当得当，衔接相当紧凑，段落相当分明。, 语文与结构 - 1 - 语句通顺，汉字的书写、词语、语法及标点符号的运用绝大多数正确。如有错误，也是极小的。用词丰富适当，句式正确且多样化，表达清楚。组织得当，衔接紧凑，段落分明。",
