2,English,Primary 6, ,"The sun's brilliant rays illuminated the morning sky. Plumes of bluish white clounds floated in a tranquil procession. It was a bright and beautiful day. I was coming home from my last day of school. I was so excited and jumped around. The school holiday had started. My parents had not planned anything for the holiday. When I was at home, I heard my parents in the room talking about where to go for the school holiday. I was shocked to see my room filled with suitcase which was packed. I knew immediately we were leaving the house for a holiday. My parents told me that we were going to malaysia. My adrenaline started pumping when I heard them say it. My parents and I immediately packed up and boarded our bus to go to malaysia. When we were at the malaysia immigration. We saw about thousands of people queuing. My parents and I queued at the shortest lane but to make problem worst the officer who was checking the passport went for a breaktime. I knew it be long wait. After an hour, the line started moving. Slowly but surely we were getting closer to the counter but it suddenly stopped. My parents saw. the sign on the board and told me that the computer in the office had broken down. I was frustrated but waited patiently. After three hours, my parents and I had crossed the counter. After waiting for a long time in the queue, my parents and I had a rest and had our dinner. I heaved sigh of relief that we were not still stuck there for far too long. My parents and I continued our journey to malaysia. At malaysia there was a lot of queues my parents and I had waited for nearly an hour but we learned something. Always be patient as we will be there in no time.", , , ,"Add: Conjunction -  Omission of conjunctions to link sentences or clauses: Incorrect: ""He didn't study he failed the exam."" Correct: ""He didn't study, so he failed the exam."" (A conjunction is needed to show the cause-effect relationship), 

Add: Determiner - Omission of determiners, such as articles, quantifiers, and possessive determiners:Incorrect: ""She bought apple and orange."" Correct: ""She bought an apple and an orange."" (Articles ""an"" are needed for singular nouns), 

Add: Particle - Omission of particles, especially in phrasal verbs: Incorrect: ""She looked up the dictionary."" Correct: ""She looked up the word in the dictionary."" (The object placement in the phrasal verb is incorrect),

Add: Preposition - Omission of prepositions, leading to grammatical errors: Incorrect: ""She is good math."" Correct: ""She is good at math."" (""Good at"" is the correct prepositional phrase in this context),

Add: Punctuation - Punctuation - Incorrect or missing punctuation marks that change the meaning: Incorrect: ""Let's eat grandma."" Correct: ""Let's eat, grandma."" (The comma clarifies that the speaker is addressing ""grandma"" rather than suggesting cannibalism)

Add: Contraction - Omission of contractions, leading to confusion: Incorrect: ""Its raining today."" Correct: ""Its raining today."" (""Its"" is possessive, while ""it's"" is the contraction for ""it is""),

Add: Possessive - Incorrect use of possessive forms ('s or s'): Incorrect: ""The dogs bone was lost."" Correct: ""The dog's bone was lost."" (""Dog's"" shows possession correctly),

Remove: Conjunction - Incorrect use of conjunctions to link sentences or clauses: Incorrect: ""Although it was cold outside, but I still went for a walk."" Correct: ""Although it was cold outside, I still went for a walk."" ('Although' and 'but' are redundant together.),

Remove: Determiner - Incorrect use of determiners, such as articles, quantifiers, and possessive determiners: Incorrect: ""I love the nature."" Correct: ""I love nature."" (""Nature"" is uncountable and does not typically take the definite article ""the""),

Remove: Possessive - Incorrect use of possessive forms ('s or s'): Incorrect: ""The dog wagged it's tail."" Correct: ""The dog wagged its tail."" (""Its"" is the possessive form, while ""it's"" is the contraction for ""it is"");

Remove: Space - Missing or extra spaces between words or punctuation: Incorrect: ""I went tothe park."" Correct: ""I went to the park."" (A missing space between ""to"" and ""the""),

Replace: Adjective - Incorrect or inappropriate use of adjectives, such as using the wrong form (comparative, superlative): Incorrect: ""She is more prettier than her sister."" Correct: ""She is prettier than her sister."" (""More"" is unnecessary because ""prettier"" is already in its comparative form); Incorrect: ""He is a very sensible player."" Correct: ""He is a very sensitive player."" (""Sensitive"" is the appropriate term depending on context),

Replace: Adverb - Incorrect use of adverbs, such as using an adjective instead of an adverb: Incorrect: ""He runs quick."" Correct: ""He runs quickly."" (""Quick"" is an adjective, but ""quickly"" is the correct adverb form to describe the verb ""runs""),

Replace: Conjunction - Incorrect use of conjunctions to link sentences or clauses: Incorrect: ""She is intelligent or beautiful."" Correct: ""She is intelligent and beautiful."" (""Or"" implies a choice, which isn't appropriate here),

Replace: Determiner - Incorrect use of determiners, such as articles, quantifiers, and possessive determiners: Incorrect: ""I need few help with this problem."" Correct: ""I need a little help with this problem."" (""A little"" is the correct quantifier for uncountable nouns like ""help"");

Replace: Noun - Incorrect noun forms, including pluralization or uncountable nouns: Incorrect: ""I have many homeworks."" Correct: ""I have a lot of homework."" (""Homework"" is uncountable and cannot take a plural form),

Replace: Particle - Incorrect use of particles, especially in phrasal verbs: Incorrect: ""Nearly 50 percent of adults fall under this category."" Correct: ""Nearly 50 percent of adults fall into this category."" (""Fall into"" is the correct phrasal verb to describe categorization),

Replace: Preposition - Incorrect prepositions, leading to grammatical errors: Incorrect: ""She is good in math."" Correct: ""She is good at math."" (""Good at"" is the correct prepositional phrase in this context),

Replace: Pronoun - Incorrect pronoun usage, including unclear references or agreement issues: Incorrect: ""Each student must bring their book."" Correct: ""Each student must bring his or her book."" (""His or her"" agrees with the singular subject ""student""),

Replace: Capitalisation - Incorrect use of uppercase and lowercase letters, especially for proper nouns and sentence beginnings: Incorrect: ""i went to paris last summer."" Correct: ""I went to Paris last summer."" (Proper nouns like ""Paris"" and sentence beginnings require capitalization),

Replace: Word/Phrase - Miscellaneous errors that don't fit other categories: Incorrect: ""I enjoy to the fullest life."" Correct: ""I enjoy life to the fullest."" (Reordering the sentence is necessary for natural phrasing),

Replace: Spelling - Incorrect spelling of words, affecting comprehension: Incorrect: ""She recieved a letter."" Correct: ""She received a letter."" (""Received"" is the correct spelling),

Replace: Word Order - Incorrect word order, making sentences sound unnatural or confusing: Incorrect: ""She always is late."" Correct: ""She is always late."" (""Always"" should come after the verb ""is""),

Replace: Verb Form - Incorrect verb form (including gerunds/infinitives): Incorrect: ""I look forward to meet you."" Correct: ""I look forward to meeting you."" (""Meeting"" is the correct gerund form after ""look forward to""),

Replace: Subject-Verb Agreement - Incorrect verb agreement: Incorrect: ""She have a car."" Correct: ""She has a car."" (""Have"" does not agree with the singular subject ""She""),

Collocation: Suggestion - Incorrect pairing of words that do not naturally go together in English: Incorrect: ""She made a big effort."" Correct: ""She made a great effort."" (""Great"" collocates naturally with ""effort"" in English)

Sentence: Fragment - Errors related to sentence structure, such as fragments or run-ons: Incorrect: ""When I arrived. I saw him."" Correct: ""When I arrived, I saw him."" (A dependent clause cannot stand alone as a sentence)","{'annotated_response': 'The sun\'s brilliant rays illuminated the morning sky.
