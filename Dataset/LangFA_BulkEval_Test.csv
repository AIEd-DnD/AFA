1,English,Primary 6, ,"""See you tommorow!"" My teacher, Ms Lim exclaimed. Everyone rushed out of the classroom like a herd of Elephants. ""La, la, la"" I hummed a tune merrily as I walked back home. It was a seemingly peaceful afternoon. When came home, I was greated with an aroma of delicious food. After gobbling up my food, I immediately started reading a new book I got for my birthday. ""Yes! I think I got to the interesting part."" I thought. Right when I turned the page, I saw it marred with crayon scribbles! I knew my younger brother did it because he just got a new set of crayons. My face turned as red as any ku Kueh. I was furious! I stormmed into my brothers room and bellowed ""WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY BOOK!"" My brother hung his head in shame and muttered "" I... I... am sorry"" At that momment I could not control my emotions so I took his favourite Stuffed toy and ripped the head off. ""That is what you get for ruining my book!"" I said angryly. My brother burst out crying. I realised what I did and thought, ""I have to fix this or else mom will scold me."" I immediately ran to my friend's house, like a crazy mad horse on steroids. You may be thinking, why would I go to my friend, Amy? Well Amy is very good at sewing so, I wanted her to sew the head of the Stuffed toy back together with the body. ""Ding! Dong!"" I ringed the bell. When amy opened the door, I said, ""hI Amy, I need you to help me sew this stuffed toy back together as fast as possible."" She immediately took the toy and started sewing. I could not believe my eyes, she was so fast. After five minutes, everything was fixed. I thanked Amy profusely. She offered me to stay a bit longer but I really had to go back home. ""See you at school!"" Amy said. I came home panting, I was drenched in sweat. I realised that my mother was comforting my brother. When I walked into the room, I apologised. ""I am so sorry for not controlling my emotions, I went out to ask Amy to sew it back together."" My brother was very appy and jumped up and down. In a nutshell My mother was very Proud of me that I took responsibility to fix it back. The next time something like this happends, I will control my emotions. I was quite happy too, even though a page of my book was ruined and I did not control my emotions, I practiced to be responsible and I dit not get scolded by my mother.", , , ,"Add: Conjunction -  Omission of conjunctions to link sentences or clauses: Incorrect: ""He didn't study he failed the exam.""

I shouted with joy as I beamed from ear to ear. Parker and I were bossom buddies. We have been through thick and thin together and were as close as a hand and a glove. Our bond was unbreakable, until Parker had to leave and go to America. We both had set a date to meet up a few months later. His family was coming back to France, and so was he! We agreed to meet up at my parents restaurant. However, I had a long wait. Parker Bruno was late. He was never late, he was the most puntural person I knew. I then decided to call him after an hour. But he did not pick up, so I gave him a voice mail. ""Parker! Where in the world are you? I have waited for an hour but you never appeared! Please don't tell me that you had forgotten our promise and bailed!"" I said with anger boiling in me, as I drank my drink and sat at the table. Just then, Parker's mother called. ""Michael!"" she said. Mrs Bruno was crying. ""Michael! Parker is in the hospital, he had an accident on the way to your familys restaurant,"" she sobbed. I stood rooted to the ground, shocked. My anger dispersed quickly as I pry the details from Mrs Bruno. ""What! Parker was in an accident? Oh, I told him to be careful as he was driving in the wee hours! Which hospital is he in? I will go there now,"" I said. ""He is at the France International Hospital."" Mrs Bruno said. Without a second thought, I got into my car and rushed to the hospital. As I got out of my car, I saw Mrs Bruno waiting outside. We both quickly went up to Parker's ward. As I opened the door, strings of confetti rained on me. I was in utter shock! There stood Parker, all safe and sound. ""Parker! I thought you were in an accident!"" I shouted, clearly annoyed. ""Hello to you to Michael. I was not, however, in an accident. Do you remember our promise that we made?"" Parker said with a sly smile. Just then, it all dawned to me when I recalled. ""Michael! Lets make a promise. After a few months, we will meet up and I promised you that you will chase after me!"" Parker, a few months ago said. Tears blurred my vision as I send him of at the airport. Until now, he is still as sly as a fox. I smiled adoringly and gathered him into a hug. ""I missed you,"" I said lovingly. ""I miss you to,"" he replied.

I waited for hours when nobody showed up and I left, when I got up from my chair my friend Alex had just arrived and asked me why I was so early to the meet up. I was shocked when he told me that the meet up will start at 3 p.m. instead of 8 a.m., I told him that I had read wrongly and had ran to the restruant at 7.30 a.m. He laughed at me saying ""next time read before you do anything and clarify if you don't understand"". when all my other classmates had arrived we started to shop then we were shocked when Alex's mother had bought 36 tickets to the new Avengers movie we watched it and was so thankful to Alex's mother for buying us tickets to the movies.

8,English,Secondary 2, ,"CCA are defined as after school learnings that allows students to be apart from educational subjects. Parents usually think that children take this as an excuse to put aside educational subjects especially in a Secondary school life. Unfortunately, that is not the case. CCA allows students to unleash their hidden talents and foster a strong bond between their friends. It can come to be a vital component of your secondary school life that not only helps you in learning new skills, but also building up your portfolio. Choosing a CCA does not mean that we choose it haparzadly in other words, we take note of the following factors such as time, sustainability, learning opportunities and how it will help in furthering your education skills. Thus, CCA is a compulsory component for students that allows one to realise their potential for future purposes and have a break from all the different subjects. Firstly, we focus on the time factor. CCA's does usually take up alot of time especially when you have extra trainings affter school. Therefore before we always choose a CCA wisely before even continuing with choosing the CCA will trully like. I am not trying to indoctrinate vryone by saying that we should keep studies away completely. We should at least make time to do things at the right timings. If not, we should strive for a CCA that wont compromise too much time on your studies. itself. Therefore, time might br taken up if we do not choose our CCA rationally. Secondly, is sustainability. Sustainability allows students to be able to sustain within ones Every secondary school student can join a CCA from sports, uniformed groups, clubs and societies, visual and performing arts group. Students have to filter and discern which CCA is best suited for ourselves. Depending on the end goal you have in mind with the CCA you decide to take up, you have to see the suitability of the CCAs offered with your interests and intended end you have set for yourself in mind. It may be a little hard to envision, but try to consider how joining this CCA will help in your post-secondary education. CCA points? Lastly, we consider on the learning opportunities that you may tend to get learn from the CCA we pick. We pick up new skills and implement it for various pirposes in life. As a matter of fact, the CCA that we choose in primary school allows one to be comfortable with one one of the new CCA that one picks. This would further enhance the ability to do well in their continuous CCA or even exceed better in the future if one has any plans ahead. Thus, in my opinion, i feel that CCA should be compulsory even though it is an not a study related activity, it would bring some benefit to their future as they pick up new skills from their CCA. CCA may seem as a uncompulsory component but it benefits in a way that unknowingly helps student set free from the long hours of work and stress load in school.", , , ,"Add: Conjunction -  Omission of conjunctions to link sentences or clauses: Incorrect: ""He didn't study he failed the exam.""

Therefore, time might <tag id=""41"">br</tag> taken up if we do not choose our CCA rationally. <tag id=""42"">Secondly, is sustainability</tag>. <tag id=""43"">Sustainability</tag> allows students to be able to <tag id=""44"">sustain</tag> <tag id=""45"">within ones</tag> Every secondary school student can join a CCA from sports, uniformed groups, clubs and societies,<tag id=""46""> </tag>visual and performing arts group. Students have to filter and discern which CCA is best suited for <tag id=""47"">ourselves</tag>. Depending on the end goal <tag id=""48"">you</tag> have in mind <tag id=""49"">with the CCA you decide to take up</tag>, you have to <tag id=""50"">see</tag> the suitability of the CCAs offered with your interests and intended <tag id=""51"">end</tag> you have set for yourself <tag id=""52"">in mind</tag>. It may be a little hard to envision<tag id=""53"">,</tag> but try to consider how joining this CCA will help in your post-secondary education. <tag id=""54"">CCA points?</tag> Lastly, we consider <tag id=""55"">on</tag> the learning opportunities that you may <tag id=""56"">tend</tag> <tag id=""57"">to get</tag> learn from the CCA we pick. We<tag id=""58""> </tag>pick up new skills and implement it for various <tag id=""59"">pirposes</tag> in life.

9,English,Secondary 2, ,"Have you ever had an embarassing incident? One that, in spite of however many days, months, or even years that have passed, you are still subject to experiencing the agony of recalling that memory? Fortunately, you are not alone, at the very least. Every man, woman, or child under the sun absolutely has one story they would rather forget. Be that as it may, recalling the past is an inherent ability that we, as humans are gifted with. It is in our nature to remember. However, there are also times where our past hampers our ability to move onward. For instance, a failure may deter an olympian from ever participating in a sports event again, even if it would have taken just one last hopeful attempt for them to win it all. With this in mind, I would like to discuss today, why I think it is more crucial to focus on the possibilities of the future, rather than the regretful sorrows that transpired in the past. To begin, I would like to make one thing clear. Our past does not, will not, and will never define who we are or limit what we can accomplish. On the contrary, I believe that it is the anguish and pain from our pasts that empower us to become greater than those who will never have that experience. For example, did you know that the world-renowned athlete, Michael Jordan, was kicked out of his highschool basketball team? It is a truely bewildering occurance to think that he could still find the will to persevere. All it took was for him to not focus on the past, but instead, use that failure to fuel his determination. And to persevere, and push on like Michael Jordan did the type of mindset that we should adopt when we think of an unfortunate past. Secondly, we, as individuals bound to the constant passage of time, can only affect the future. If that is so, then why should you, or anyone for that matter, ever spare a thought for the things in the past that you would rather leave in the past? The future is yours to mold. The future is the only changing constant that mankind can strive to change for the benefit of tomorrow. Lastly, concentrating your efforts on the future can help to make you more goal-oriented and determined. Moreover, it can maximize your productivity so that you can make the most of your time. For instance, Elon Musk, a billionaire, said that most of his time on weekdays, and weekends even, are spent working to improve his products, such as the famous Tesla, an electric car brand. As a result, he does not have spend significant time on hobbies or other things that do not help him achieve his goals. Focusing on the future to attain your goals could make you a billionaire someday, as well. At the end of the day, the past is locked in place. We can grieve and remember the past, but you should make a conscious effort to never take the past as a reminder of negative or unproductive things. Instead, use it to propel and empower yourself to the feats that you seek to attain in your future. Only then, are we truly living our lives.", , , ,"Add: Conjunction -  Omission of conjunctions to link sentences or clauses: Incorrect: ""He didn't study he failed the exam.""

10,English,Secondary 2, ,"Many children seem to be glued to their phones, without having a time limit. They normally use their phones in the night, which causes to sleep late. Phones can be very addictive as there is games, and even youtube, just to let children enjoy their time. This causes them to be unable to focus in class, as they will not have enough sleep. hence, parents should actually put a limit to their children's time on electronic devices. Firstly, using all these electronic devices without any time limit will lead to any of the children's eyesight to spoil. When using too much electronic devices, like phones and tabllets, the chances of the eyes getting spoilt is quite high, as the brightness level is normally hugh, and children like to put the phones and tablets at leat just 15 cm awaty only, and that is not so far. If the brightness level is high, it is very risky. Hence, when children do niot have a time limit for using their electronic device, they will uncotrollably use their device, until their eyesight power will slowly worsen. Secondly, students wont be able to focus in class well, which will cause them to lack information that is teached in class. This is because they will not have enough sleep, due to them spending much time on their phones at night. Normally, children who dont feel tired at night, will use their phone until late night, and when they see the time, they become suprised as it would become too late, after they watch youtube and play games. Hence, without the time limit, the children will use their phone till they do not have enoough sleep, Lastly, children in future will not be focusing more on the amount of sleep they get, as they will get used to the the huge amount of time they use on their electronic device. In future, children might continue to sleep late, and lack the amount of sleep needed, which will lead to failure in future. Hence, it is better for parents to put a time limit to the usage of electronic devices for their children. Overall, parents should take control in terms of the time their children use on electronic devices. If parents do not make the right move now, in future their kids are just going to be letting their eyesihght to get worser, and lack sleep.

12,English,Secondary 2, ,"""Keep calm and love homework.""-Anonymous. Homework is an essential tool in our lives, and many people get pressured and stressed by the overload of homework that they receive from their teachers over days some even going to the extent of crying. Homework was invented in 1905 by Robert Nevilin and is still very much present in today's modern schools. In my opinion, homework can be very useful to us and I do not agree with this statement. Many people complain that homework is useless. To begin with, homework is useful as it helps students learn to manage their time properly. Homework allows students to plan their time, so that they have sufficient time to study, do their homework, and also for leisure. The students will be able to learn how to put their homework as their first priority so that in the future, when they are working, they will be efficient and fast. However, there are also downsides to having homework. One may feel too stressed from keeping up deadlines and may not be able to cope with the enormous stress that they gain from it. Furthermore, homework can also help to improve one's grades, it can motivate students to continue studying and may even teach them a thing or two. In 2020, a research was conducted by Oxford University. They found out that 95% of students who consistently do their homework, do extraordinarily well in grades compared to students who are lazy and refuse to do their homework. In addition, homework also is a good way for revision. You can refer to it anytime you want one it has been marked and if there is any questions that needs to be clarified or, one may get wrong they can always ask the teacher how to solve the problem. Whatever homework students may not be able to do well in their studies and might not be motivated for school. Finally, homework is not a waste of time as without homework, many people will not be able to check if they are doing well in their studies or not. Homework helps to improve one's knowledge on the topic that they are doing and allows one to get better at it. If they are getting all the questions in the homework wrong, they will know which areas require improvements. From doing this, their grades will also improve and the students will be scoring higher marks compared to the homework as did not exist. Many people make the argument that people will have to sleep late if there is homework. However, if one has enough discipline and integrity, they will be able to finish their homework in time and be able to sleep early. In conclusion, homework is not a waste of time and it is very essential and useful in a student's life. Without it, many students may not be able to cope with their studies and eventually, their grades will dwindle.", , , ,"Add: Conjunction -  Omission of conjunctions to link sentences or clauses: Incorrect: ""He didn't study he failed the exam.""

Homework is an essential tool in our lives, and many people get pressured and stressed by the overload of homework that they receive from their teachers <tag id=""1"">over days</tag><tag id=""2""> </tag>some even going to the extent of crying. Homework was invented in 1905 by Robert Nevilin and is still very much present in today\'s modern schools. In my opinion, homework can be very useful to us and I do not agree with this statement. Many people complain that homework is useless. To begin with, homework is useful as it helps students learn to manage their time properly. Homework allows students to plan their time, so that they have sufficient time to study, do their homework, and also for leisure. The students will be able to learn how to put their homework as their first priority so that in the future, when they are working, they will be efficient and fast. However, there are also downsides to having homework. One may feel too stressed from keeping up<tag id=""3""> </tag>deadlines and may not be able to cope with the enormous stress that they gain from it. Furthermore, homework can also help to improve one\'s grades<tag id=""4"">,</tag> it can motivate students to continue studying and may even teach them a thing or two. In 2020, <tag id=""5"">a research</tag> was conducted by Oxford University. They found out that 95% of students who consistently do their homework, do extraordinarily well in grades compared to students who are lazy and refuse to do their homework. In addition, homework <tag id=""6"">also is</tag> a good way <tag id=""7"">for revision</tag>. You can refer to it anytime you want <tag id=""8"">one</tag> it has been marked and if there is any <tag id=""9"">questions</tag> that needs to be clarified or<tag id=""10"">,</tag> one may get wrong<tag id=""11""> </tag>they can always ask the teacher how to solve the problem. <tag id=""12"">Whatever</tag> homework<tag id=""13""> </tag>students may not be able to do well in their studies and might not be motivated for school. Finally, homework is not a waste of time as without homework, many people will not be able to check if they are doing well in their studies or not. Homework helps to improve one\'s knowledge on the topic that they are doing and allows one to get better at it. If they are getting all the questions in the homework wrong, they will know which areas require <tag id=""14"">improvements</tag>. <tag id=""15"">From</tag> doing this, their grades will also improve and the students will be scoring higher marks <tag id=""16"">compared to the homework as did not exist</tag>. Many people make the argument that people will have to sleep late if there is homework. However, if one has enough discipline and integrity, <tag id=""17"">they</tag> will be able to finish <tag id=""18"">their</tag> homework <tag id=""19"">in</tag> time and be able to sleep early. In conclusion, homework is not a waste of time<tag id=""20""> </tag>and it is very essential and useful in a student\'s life. Without it, many students may not be able to cope with their studies and eventually, their grades will <tag id=""21"">dwindle</tag>.', 'feedback_list': [{'id': 1, 'phrase': 'over days', 'error_tag': [{'errorType': 'Remove: Word/Phrase'}], 'comment': '- remove ‘over days’'}, {'id': 2, 'phrase': ' ', 'error_tag': [{'errorType': 'Add: Punctuation'}], 'comment': ','}, {'id': 3, 'phrase': ' ', 'error_tag': [{'errorType': 'Add: Preposition'}], 'comment': 'with'}, {'id': 4, 'phrase': ',', 'error_tag': [{'errorType': 'Replace: Punctuation'}], 'comment': ' - .

13,English,Secondary 2, ,"Homework is something most students dread and claim to be a waste of time and hence, this brought about many contrasting views towards homework being a waste of time. while some people think that homework is a waste of time, I think that home work is actually useful for students. Therefore, I disagree that homework is a waste of time. Firstly, homework acts as a mini test or a revision of a topic you did. So although you might think that you learnt everything you need to learn in school, homework actually tests your application skills. In other words, homework test how you can use what you have learnt to answer questions. Therefore, homeworks can act as a mini test not only to test your knowledge of the topic, but also to test how you answer the topic. Secondly, especially for subjects like mathematics, homework can also act as a practice. Mathematics is a subject that many require practice as the more you practice, the more you get to familiarise the question types that might be tested for an exam. In addition, you do not have to mark your work yourself and if you are unsure of a question or got something wrong, the teacher would be able to go through the homework with the whole class. Thus, I think that homework can act as a practice for students. Lastly, I think that homework works as good revision notes to refer to for example, with the past worksheets or homework you did, you can take note of the questions you got incorrect and memorise the corrections or how to avoid that mistake. Therefore, worksheets can work as a helpful last-minute revision tool. In a nutshell, homework is a very useful learning tool that can play a part in how well you do in an exam. Although only doing homework is not enough to secure your results, I hope that people would start taking homework more seriously as it could play a huge role in you doing well for your examinations.", , , ,"Add: Conjunction -  Omission of conjunctions to link sentences or clauses: Incorrect: ""He didn't study he failed the exam.""
