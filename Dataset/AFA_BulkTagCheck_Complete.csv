1,English,Primary 6, ,"""See you tommorow!"" My teacher, Ms Lim exclaimed. Everyone rushed out of the classroom like a herd of Elephants. ""La, la, la"" I hummed a tune merrily as I walked back home. It was a seemingly peaceful afternoon. When came home, I was greated with an aroma of delicious food. After gobbling up my food, I immediately started reading a new book I got for my birthday. ""Yes! I think I got to the interesting part."" I thought. Right when I turned the page, I saw it marred with crayon scribbles! I knew my younger brother did it because he just got a new set of crayons. My face turned as red as any ku Kueh. I was furious! I stormmed into my brothers room and bellowed ""WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY BOOK!"" My brother hung his head in shame and muttered "" I... I... am sorry"" At that momment I could not control my emotions so I took his favourite Stuffed toy and ripped the head off. ""That is what you get for ruining my book!"" I said angryly. My brother burst out crying. I realised what I did and thought, ""I have to fix this or else mom will scold me."" I immediately ran to my friend's house, like a crazy mad horse on steroids.

20,English,Primary 6, ,"The sun's brilliant rays illuminated the morning sky. Plumes of bluish white clounds floated in a tranquil procession. It was a bright and beautiful day. I was coming home from my last day of school. I was so excited and jumped around. The school holiday had started. My parents had not planned anything for the holiday. When I was at home, I heard my parents in the room talking about where to go for the school holiday. I was shocked to see my room filled with suitcase which was packed. I knew immediately we were leaving the house for a holiday. My parents told me that we were going to malaysia. My adrenaline started pumping when I heard them say it. My parents and I immediately packed up and boarded our bus to go to malaysia. When we were at the malaysia immigration. We saw about thousands of people queuing. My parents and I queued at the shortest lane but to make problem worst the officer who was checking the passport went for a breaktime. I knew it be long wait. After an hour, the line started moving. Slowly but surely we were getting closer to the counter but it suddenly stopped. My parents saw. the sign on the board and told me that the computer in the office had broken down. I was frustrated but waited patiently. After three hours, my parents and I had crossed the counter. After waiting for a long time in the queue, my parents and I had a rest and had our dinner. I heaved sigh of relief that we were not still stuck there for far too long. My parents and I continued our journey to malaysia.

70,English,Primary 6, ,"Ring, ring, ring the school bell rang, me and my friend Alex were discussing about the class meetup after graduation.

""I think we should'nt do too much we may get too tired and is too early to think about it, focus on your studies."" When I reached home, I realised that the meetup was in 2 months after that, I focused on my studies and I graduated, after a few weeks went by as per normal, I waited and waited till the day has come when we discussed in a group chat to meet up at a near by restruant. I waited for hours when nobody showed up and I left, when I got up from my chair my friend Alex had just arrived and asked me why I was so early to the meet up. I was shocked when he told me that the meet up will start at 3 p.m. instead of 8 a.m., I told him that I had read wrongly and had ran to the restruant at 7.30 a.m. He laughed at me saying ""next time read before you do anything and clarify if you don't understand"". when all my other classmates had arrived we started to shop then we were shocked when Alex's mother had bought 36 tickets to the new Avengers movie we watched it and was so thankful to Alex's mother for buying us tickets to the movies.

71,English,Secondary 2, ,"CCA are defined as after school learnings that allows students to be apart from educational subjects. Parents usually think that children take this as an excuse to put aside educational subjects especially in a Secondary school life. Unfortunately, that is not the case. CCA allows students to unleash their hidden talents and foster a strong bond between their friends. It can come to be a vital component of your secondary school life that not only helps you in learning new skills, but also building up your portfolio. Choosing a CCA does not mean that we choose it haparzadly in other words, we take note of the following factors such as time, sustainability, learning opportunities and how it will help in furthering your education skills. Thus, CCA is a compulsory component for students that allows one to realise their potential for future purposes and have a break from all the different subjects. Firstly, we focus on the time factor. CCA's does usually take up alot of time especially when you have extra trainings affter school. Therefore before we always choose a CCA wisely before even continuing with choosing the CCA will trully like. I am not trying to indoctrinate vryone by saying that we should keep studies away completely. We should at least make time to do things at the right timings. If not, we should strive for a CCA that wont compromise too much time on your studies. itself. Therefore, time might br taken up if we do not choose our CCA rationally. Secondly, is sustainability. Sustainability allows students to be able to sustain within ones Every secondary school student can join a CCA from sports, uniformed groups, clubs and societies, visual and performing arts group. Students have to filter and discern which CCA is best suited for ourselves. Depending on the end goal you have in mind with the CCA you decide to take up, you have to see the suitability of the CCAs offered with your interests and intended end you have set for yourself in mind. It may be a little hard to envision, but try to consider how joining this CCA will help in your post-secondary education. CCA points? Lastly, we consider on the learning opportunities that you may tend to get learn from the CCA we pick. We pick up new skills and implement it for various pirposes in life. As a matter of fact, the CCA that we choose in primary school allows one to be comfortable with one one of the new CCA that one picks. This would further enhance the ability to do well in their continuous CCA or even exceed better in the future if one has any plans ahead. Thus, in my opinion, i feel that CCA should be compulsory even though it is an not a study related activity, it would bring some benefit to their future as they pick up new skills from their CCA.

76,English,Secondary 2, ,"CCA are defined as after school learnings that allows students to be apart from educational subjects. Parents usually think that children take this as an excuse to put aside educational subjects especially in a Secondary school life. Unfortunately, that is not the case. CCA allows students to unleash their hidden talents and foster a strong bond between their friends. It can come to be a vital component of your secondary school life that not only helps you in learning new skills, but also building up your portfolio. Choosing a CCA does not mean that we choose it haparzadly in other words, we take note of the following factors such as time, sustainability, learning opportunities and how it will help in furthering your education skills. Thus, CCA is a compulsory component for students that allows one to realise their potential for future purposes and have a break from all the different subjects. Firstly, we focus on the time factor. CCA's does usually take up alot of time especially when you have extra trainings affter school. Therefore before we always choose a CCA wisely before even continuing with choosing the CCA will trully like. I am not trying to indoctrinate vryone by saying that we should keep studies away completely. We should at least make time to do things at the right timings. If not, we should strive for a CCA that wont compromise too much time on your studies. itself. Therefore, time might br taken up if we do not choose our CCA rationally. Secondly, is sustainability. Sustainability allows students to be able to sustain within ones Every secondary school student can join a CCA from sports, uniformed groups, clubs and societies, visual and performing arts group. Students have to filter and discern which CCA is best suited for ourselves.

This would further enhance the ability to do well in their continuous CCA or even exceed better in the future if one has any plans ahead.

81,English,Secondary 2, ,"Have you ever had an embarassing incident? One that, in spite of however many days, months, or even years that have passed, you are still subject to experiencing the agony of recalling that memory? Fortunately, you are not alone, at the very least. Every man, woman, or child under the sun absolutely has one story they would rather forget. Be that as it may, recalling the past is an inherent ability that we, as humans are gifted with. It is in our nature to remember. However, there are also times where our past hampers our ability to move onward. For instance, a failure may deter an olympian from ever participating in a sports event again, even if it would have taken just one last hopeful attempt for them to win it all. With this in mind, I would like to discuss today, why I think it is more crucial to focus on the possibilities of the future, rather than the regretful sorrows that transpired in the past. To begin, I would like to make one thing clear. Our past does not, will not, and will never define who we are or limit what we can accomplish. On the contrary, I believe that it is the anguish and pain from our pasts that empower us to become greater than those who will never have that experience. For example, did you know that the world-renowned athlete, Michael Jordan, was kicked out of his highschool basketball team? It is a truely bewildering occurance to think that he could still find the will to persevere. All it took was for him to not focus on the past, but instead, use that failure to fuel his determination. And to persevere, and push on like Michael Jordan did the type of mindset that we should adopt when we think of an unfortunate past. Secondly, we, as individuals bound to the constant passage of time, can only affect the future. If that is so, then why should you, or anyone for that matter, ever spare a thought for the things in the past that you would rather leave in the past? The future is yours to mold. The future is the only changing constant that mankind can strive to change for the benefit of tomorrow. Lastly, concentrating your efforts on the future can help to make you more goal-oriented and determined. Moreover, it can maximize your productivity so that you can make the most of your time. For instance, Elon Musk, a billionaire, said that most of his time on weekdays, and weekends even, are spent working to improve his products, such as the famous Tesla, an electric car brand. As a result, he does not have spend significant time on hobbies or other things that do not help him achieve his goals. Focusing on the future to attain your goals could make you a billionaire someday, as well. At the end of the day, the past is locked in place.

82,English,Secondary 2, ,"Have you ever had an embarassing incident? One that, in spite of however many days, months, or even years that have passed, you are still subject to experiencing the agony of recalling that memory? Fortunately, you are not alone, at the very least. Every man, woman, or child under the sun absolutely has one story they would rather forget. Be that as it may, recalling the past is an inherent ability that we, as humans are gifted with. It is in our nature to remember. However, there are also times where our past hampers our ability to move onward. For instance, a failure may deter an olympian from ever participating in a sports event again, even if it would have taken just one last hopeful attempt for them to win it all. With this in mind, I would like to discuss today, why I think it is more crucial to focus on the possibilities of the future, rather than the regretful sorrows that transpired in the past. To begin, I would like to make one thing clear. Our past does not, will not, and will never define who we are or limit what we can accomplish. On the contrary, I believe that it is the anguish and pain from our pasts that empower us to become greater than those who will never have that experience. For example, did you know that the world-renowned athlete, Michael Jordan, was kicked out of his highschool basketball team? It is a truely bewildering occurance to think that he could still find the will to persevere. All it took was for him to not focus on the past, but instead, use that failure to fuel his determination. And to persevere, and push on like Michael Jordan did the type of mindset that we should adopt when we think of an unfortunate past. Secondly, we, as individuals bound to the constant passage of time, can only affect the future. If that is so, then why should you, or anyone for that matter, ever spare a thought for the things in the past that you would rather leave in the past? The future is yours to mold. The future is the only changing constant that mankind can strive to change for the benefit of tomorrow. Lastly, concentrating your efforts on the future can help to make you more goal-oriented and determined. Moreover, it can maximize your productivity so that you can make the most of your time. For instance, Elon Musk, a billionaire, said that most of his time on weekdays, and weekends even, are spent working to improve his products, such as the famous Tesla, an electric car brand. As a result, he does not have spend significant time on hobbies or other things that do not help him achieve his goals. Focusing on the future to attain your goals could make you a billionaire someday, as well. At the end of the day, the past is locked in place. We can grieve and remember the past, but you should make a conscious effort to never take the past as a reminder of negative or unproductive things.

87,English,Secondary 2, ,"Have you ever had an embarassing incident? One that, in spite of however many days, months, or even years that have passed, you are still subject to experiencing the agony of recalling that memory? Fortunately, you are not alone, at the very least. Every man, woman, or child under the sun absolutely has one story they would rather forget. Be that as it may, recalling the past is an inherent ability that we, as humans are gifted with. It is in our nature to remember. However, there are also times where our past hampers our ability to move onward. For instance, a failure may deter an olympian from ever participating in a sports event again, even if it would have taken just one last hopeful attempt for them to win it all. With this in mind, I would like to discuss today, why I think it is more crucial to focus on the possibilities of the future, rather than the regretful sorrows that transpired in the past. To begin, I would like to make one thing clear. Our past does not, will not, and will never define who we are or limit what we can accomplish. On the contrary, I believe that it is the anguish and pain from our pasts that empower us to become greater than those who will never have that experience. For example, did you know that the world-renowned athlete, Michael Jordan, was kicked out of his highschool basketball team? It is a truely bewildering occurance to think that he could still find the will to persevere. All it took was for him to not focus on the past, but instead, use that failure to fuel his determination. And to persevere, and push on like Michael Jordan did the type of mindset that we should adopt when we think of an unfortunate past. Secondly, we, as individuals bound to the constant passage of time, can only affect the future. If that is so, then why should you, or anyone for that matter, ever spare a thought for the things in the past that you would rather leave in the past? The future is yours to mold. The future is the only changing constant that mankind can strive to change for the benefit of tomorrow. Lastly, concentrating your efforts on the future can help to make you more goal-oriented and determined. Moreover, it can maximize your productivity so that you can make the most of your time. For instance, Elon Musk, a billionaire, said that most of his time on weekdays, and weekends even, are spent working to improve his products, such as the famous Tesla, an electric car brand. As a result, he does not have spend significant time on hobbies or other things that do not help him achieve his goals. Focusing on the future to attain your goals could make you a billionaire someday, as well. At the end of the day, the past is locked in place. We can grieve and remember the past, but you should make a conscious effort to never take the past as a reminder of negative or unproductive things. Instead, use it to propel and empower yourself to the feats that you seek to attain in your future.

93,English,Secondary 2, ,"Many children seem to be glued to their phones, without having a time limit. They normally use their phones in the night, which causes to sleep late. Phones can be very addictive as there is games, and even youtube, just to let children enjoy their time. This causes them to be unable to focus in class, as they will not have enough sleep. hence, parents should actually put a limit to their children's time on electronic devices. Firstly, using all these electronic devices without any time limit will lead to any of the children's eyesight to spoil. When using too much electronic devices, like phones and tabllets, the chances of the eyes getting spoilt is quite high, as the brightness level is normally hugh, and children like to put the phones and tablets at leat just 15 cm awaty only, and that is not so far. If the brightness level is high, it is very risky. Hence, when children do niot have a time limit for using their electronic device, they will uncotrollably use their device, until their eyesight power will slowly worsen. Secondly, students wont be able to focus in class well, which will cause them to lack information that is teached in class. This is because they will not have enough sleep, due to them spending much time on their phones at night. Normally, children who dont feel tired at night, will use their phone until late night, and when they see the time, they become suprised as it would become too late, after they watch youtube and play games. Hence, without the time limit, the children will use their phone till they do not have enoough sleep, Lastly, children in future will not be focusing more on the amount of sleep they get, as they will get used to the the huge amount of time they use on their electronic device. In future, children might continue to sleep late, and lack the amount of sleep needed, which will lead to failure in future. Hence, it is better for parents to put a time limit to the usage of electronic devices for their children.

99,English,Secondary 2, ,"Many children seem to be glued to their phones, without having a time limit. They normally use their phones in the night, which causes to sleep late. Phones can be very addictive as there is games, and even youtube, just to let children enjoy their time. This causes them to be unable to focus in class, as they will not have enough sleep. hence, parents should actually put a limit to their children's time on electronic devices. Firstly, using all these electronic devices without any time limit will lead to any of the children's eyesight to spoil. When using too much electronic devices, like phones and tabllets, the chances of the eyes getting spoilt is quite high, as the brightness level is normally hugh, and children like to put the phones and tablets at leat just 15 cm awaty only, and that is not so far. If the brightness level is high, it is very risky. Hence, when children do niot have a time limit for using their electronic device, they will uncotrollably use their device, until their eyesight power will slowly worsen. Secondly, students wont be able to focus in class well, which will cause them to lack information that is teached in class. This is because they will not have enough sleep, due to them spending much time on their phones at night. Normally, children who dont feel tired at night, will use their phone until late night, and when they see the time, they become suprised as it would become too late, after they watch youtube and play games. Hence, without the time limit, the children will use their phone till they do not have enoough sleep, Lastly, children in future will not be focusing more on the amount of sleep they get, as they will get used to the the huge amount of time they use on their electronic device. In future, children might continue to sleep late, and lack the amount of sleep needed, which will lead to failure in future. Hence, it is better for parents to put a time limit to the usage of electronic devices for their children. Overall, parents should take control in terms of the time their children use on electronic devices.

Homework is an essential tool in our lives, and many people get pressured and stressed by the overload of homework that they receive from their teachers over days some even going to the extent of crying. Homework was invented in 1905 by Robert Nevilin and is still very much present in today's modern schools. In my opinion, homework can be very useful to us and I do not agree with this statement. Many people complain that homework is useless. To begin with, homework is useful as it helps students learn to manage their time properly. Homework allows students to plan their time, so that they have sufficient time to study, do their homework, and also for leisure. The students will be able to learn how to put their homework as their first priority so that in the future, when they are working, they will be efficient and fast. However, there are also downsides to having homework. One may feel too stressed from keeping up deadlines and may not be able to cope with the enormous stress that they gain from it. Furthermore, homework can also help to improve one's grades, it can motivate students to continue studying and may even teach them a thing or two. In 2020, a research was conducted by Oxford University. They found out that 95 percent of students who consistently do their homework, do extraordinarily well in grades compared to students who are lazy and refuse to do their homework. In addition, homework also is a good way for revision. You can refer to it anytime you want one it has been marked and if there is any questions that needs to be clarified or, one may get wrong they can always ask the teacher how to solve the problem. Whatever homework students may not be able to do well in their studies and might not be motivated for school. Finally, homework is not a waste of time as without homework, many people will not be able to check if they are doing well in their studies or not. Homework helps to improve one's knowledge on the topic that they are doing and allows one to get better at it. If they are getting all the questions in the homework wrong, they will know which areas require improvements. From doing this, their grades will also improve and the students will be scoring higher marks compared to the homework as did not exist. Many people make the argument that people will have to sleep late if there is homework. However, if one has enough discipline and integrity, they will be able to finish their homework in time and be able to sleep early. In conclusion, homework is not a waste of time and it is very essential and useful in a student's life.

Homework is an essential tool in our lives, and many people get pressured and stressed by the overload of homework that they receive from their teachers over days some even going to the extent of crying. Homework was invented in 1905 by Robert Nevilin and is still very much present in today's modern schools. In my opinion, homework can be very useful to us and I do not agree with this statement. Many people complain that homework is useless. To begin with, homework is useful as it helps students learn to manage their time properly. Homework allows students to plan their time, so that they have sufficient time to study, do their homework, and also for leisure. The students will be able to learn how to put their homework as their first priority so that in the future, when they are working, they will be efficient and fast. However, there are also downsides to having homework. One may feel too stressed from keeping up deadlines and may not be able to cope with the enormous stress that they gain from it. Furthermore, homework can also help to improve one's grades, it can motivate students to continue studying and may even teach them a thing or two. In 2020, a research was conducted by Oxford University. They found out that 95 percent of students who consistently do their homework, do extraordinarily well in grades compared to students who are lazy and refuse to do their homework. In addition, homework also is a good way for revision. You can refer to it anytime you want one it has been marked and if there is any questions that needs to be clarified or, one may get wrong they can always ask the teacher how to solve the problem. Whatever homework students may not be able to do well in their studies and might not be motivated for school. Finally, homework is not a waste of time as without homework, many people will not be able to check if they are doing well in their studies or not. Homework helps to improve one's knowledge on the topic that they are doing and allows one to get better at it. If they are getting all the questions in the homework wrong, they will know which areas require improvements. From doing this, their grades will also improve and the students will be scoring higher marks compared to the homework as did not exist. Many people make the argument that people will have to sleep late if there is homework. However, if one has enough discipline and integrity, they will be able to finish their homework in time and be able to sleep early.

Homework is an essential tool in our lives, and many people get pressured and stressed by the overload of homework that they receive from their teachers over days some even going to the extent of crying. Homework was invented in 1905 by Robert Nevilin and is still very much present in today's modern schools. In my opinion, homework can be very useful to us and I do not agree with this statement. Many people complain that homework is useless. To begin with, homework is useful as it helps students learn to manage their time properly. Homework allows students to plan their time, so that they have sufficient time to study, do their homework, and also for leisure. The students will be able to learn how to put their homework as their first priority so that in the future, when they are working, they will be efficient and fast. However, there are also downsides to having homework. One may feel too stressed from keeping up deadlines and may not be able to cope with the enormous stress that they gain from it. Furthermore, homework can also help to improve one's grades, it can motivate students to continue studying and may even teach them a thing or two. In 2020, a research was conducted by Oxford University. They found out that 95 percent of students who consistently do their homework, do extraordinarily well in grades compared to students who are lazy and refuse to do their homework. In addition, homework also is a good way for revision. You can refer to it anytime you want one it has been marked and if there is any questions that needs to be clarified or, one may get wrong they can always ask the teacher how to solve the problem. Whatever homework students may not be able to do well in their studies and might not be motivated for school. Finally, homework is not a waste of time as without homework, many people will not be able to check if they are doing well in their studies or not. Homework helps to improve one's knowledge on the topic that they are doing and allows one to get better at it. If they are getting all the questions in the homework wrong, they will know which areas require improvements. From doing this, their grades will also improve and the students will be scoring higher marks compared to the homework as did not exist. Many people make the argument that people will have to sleep late if there is homework.

121,English,Secondary 2, ,"Homework is something most students dread and claim to be a waste of time and hence, this brought about many contrasting views towards homework being a waste of time. while some people think that homework is a waste of time, I think that home work is actually useful for students. Therefore, I disagree that homework is a waste of time. Firstly, homework acts as a mini test or a revision of a topic you did. So although you might think that you learnt everything you need to learn in school, homework actually tests your application skills. In other words, homework test how you can use what you have learnt to answer questions. Therefore, homeworks can act as a mini test not only to test your knowledge of the topic, but also to test how you answer the topic. Secondly, especially for subjects like mathematics, homework can also act as a practice. Mathematics is a subject that many require practice as the more you practice, the more you get to familiarise the question types that might be tested for an exam. In addition, you do not have to mark your work yourself and if you are unsure of a question or got something wrong, the teacher would be able to go through the homework with the whole class. Thus, I think that homework can act as a practice for students. Lastly, I think that homework works as good revision notes to refer to for example, with the past worksheets or homework you did, you can take note of the questions you got incorrect and memorise the corrections or how to avoid that mistake. Therefore, worksheets can work as a helpful last-minute revision tool. In a nutshell, homework is a very useful learning tool that can play a part in how well you do in an exam.

125,English,Secondary 2, ,"Homework is something most students dread and claim to be a waste of time and hence, this brought about many contrasting views towards homework being a waste of time. while some people think that homework is a waste of time, I think that home work is actually useful for students. Therefore, I disagree that homework is a waste of time. Firstly, homework acts as a mini test or a revision of a topic you did. So although you might think that you learnt everything you need to learn in school, homework actually tests your application skills. In other words, homework test how you can use what you have learnt to answer questions. Therefore, homeworks can act as a mini test not only to test your knowledge of the topic, but also to test how you answer the topic. Secondly, especially for subjects like mathematics, homework can also act as a practice. Mathematics is a subject that many require practice as the more you practice, the more you get to familiarise the question types that might be tested for an exam. In addition, you do not have to mark your work yourself and if you are unsure of a question or got something wrong, the teacher would be able to go through the homework with the whole class. Thus, I think that homework can act as a practice for students. Lastly, I think that homework works as good revision notes to refer to for example, with the past worksheets or homework you did, you can take note of the questions you got incorrect and memorise the corrections or how to avoid that mistake. Therefore, worksheets can work as a helpful last-minute revision tool. In a nutshell, homework is a very useful learning tool that can play a part in how well you do in an exam.

A red truck had run a stop sign and hit their car from the side. Jake felt a strong jolt, and his seatbelt held him back. His dad quickly turned the wheel to stop the car from going off the road. The car came to a stop, and Jake's heart was beating fast.

A red truck had run a stop sign and hit their car from the side. Jake felt a strong jolt, and his seatbelt held him back. His dad quickly turned the wheel to stop the car from going off the road. The car came to a stop, and Jake's heart was beating fast.
His dad asked, “Are you okay?” Jake nodded, but he was scared. People from other cars ran over to help. The driver of the red truck got out and said, “I'm so sorry! I didn't see the sign.”
Soon, a police officer and an ambulance arrived. The paramedics checked Jake and his dad, but they were not hurt. The officer talked to the truck driver and wrote things down.
Jake's dad called a tow truck. “Cars can be fixed,” he said. “What matters is that we're safe.”
Jake looked at the dented car and took a deep breath.

151,English,Primary 6, ,"I used to think that hard work was not necessary and that I could always take shortcuts to achieve my goals. However, one incident changed my mindset forever, teaching me a valuable lesson about perseverance and responsibility.

It all started when my teacher announced that there would be a class mathematics competition. The winner would receive a trophy and a gift voucher. I was thrilled because I had always wanted to be recognised for my achievements. However, instead of practising diligently, I assumed that my natural ability would be enough to win. I only skimmed through a few questions the night before and went to bed early, confident that I would do well.

The next day, I walked into the classroom feeling excited. The competition began, and I was given a set of challenging math problems. As I stared at the questions, my confidence quickly faded. My mind went blank. I realised that I had no idea how to solve most of them. My hands grew clammy, and my heart pounded. I glanced around and saw my classmates deep in thought, solving the problems with ease. At that moment, regret filled me. If only I had prepared properly!

When the results were announced, I did not even make it to the top five. My face burned with embarrassment as my teacher handed the trophy to my best friend, Jason. He had worked tirelessly every day, revising and practising different types of questions. I felt a pang of guilt, knowing that I had taken the competition too lightly.

After school, I congratulated Jason and admitted that I had not put in enough effort. He smiled and said, “Hard work always pays off. You can do better next time if you really try.” His words stuck with me. That day, I made a promise to myself—to never take shortcuts again and to always put in my best effort.

Since then, I have learned the importance of perseverance and responsibility. Success does not come easily; it requires dedication and effort.

It all started when my teacher announced that there would be a class mathematics competition. The winner would receive a trophy and a gift voucher. I was thrilled because I had always wanted to be recognised for my achievements. However, instead of practising diligently, I assumed that my natural ability would be enough to win. I only skimmed through a few questions the night before and went to bed early, confident that I would do well.

My mind went blank. I realised that I had no idea how to solve most of them. My hands grew clammy, and my heart pounded.

He had worked tirelessly every day, revising and practising different types of questions. I felt a pang of guilt, knowing that I had taken the competition too lightly.

After school, I congratulated Jason and admitted that I had not put in enough effort. He smiled and said, “Hard work always pays off. You can do better next time if you really try.” His words stuck with me. That day, I made a promise to myself—to never take shortcuts again and to always put in my best effort.

161,English,Primary 6, ,"Guilt weighed heavily on me as I replayed the argument in my mind. It had all started with a simple misunderstanding, but it had caused a rift between me and my best friend.

Jake and I had been inseparable since childhood. We did everything together, from playing video games and riding our bicycles around the neighbourhood to staying up late talking about life. He was the one person I could always count on, and I never thought anything could come between us. But one day, something happened that made me question our friendship.

I was walking past the school canteen when I heard laughter coming from a group of students. As I got closer, I recognised Jake’s voice among them. My heart sank when I heard my name being mentioned, followed by more laughter. My stomach twisted. Was he making fun of me? Was he telling jokes at my expense? A surge of anger and betrayal coursed through me.

Without waiting to hear more, I turned on my heel and walked away, my mind spinning. I felt humiliated and hurt. How could he, my best friend, talk about me behind my back? That evening, I could not shake the bitterness that filled me. The next day, I confronted him, my emotions bubbling over like a volcano about to erupt.

“How could you do that to me?” I snapped, my hands clenched into fists.

Jake looked confused. “What are you talking about?”

“Don’t play dumb! I heard you laughing about me with your new friends,” I accused, my voice rising.

His expression changed from confusion to hurt. “I wasn’t making fun of you,” he said, his tone defensive.

But I wasn’t in the mood to listen. Without giving him a chance to explain, I stormed off. Over the next few days, I ignored him completely. I avoided him in class, refused to respond to his texts, and even turned away when he tried to talk to me. I convinced myself that I was right to be angry.

It wasn’t until a few days later that I spoke to another friend about what had happened. He looked surprised and told me that I had completely misunderstood the situation. “Jake wasn’t making fun of you,” he said. “He was actually sharing a funny memory about the time you two got lost during last year’s school camp. Everyone was laughing because it was such a ridiculous story, not because they were mocking you.”

A cold wave of realisation washed over me. I had let my anger cloud my judgment. Instead of talking to Jake and finding out the truth, I had assumed the worst and shut him out. I had hurt someone who had always stood by me.

That evening, I mustered the courage to call him. As the phone rang, my heart pounded. What if he was still upset? What if I had ruined our friendship beyond repair?

When Jake picked up, I took a deep breath. “Jake, I’m so sorry,” I said, my voice trembling. “I should’ve trusted you instead of assuming the worst. I realise now that I jumped to conclusions without even giving you a chance to explain.”

There was a pause, and then he let out a small chuckle. “I was wondering when you’d come to your senses,” he said. “I was pretty hurt, you know. But I forgive you. Next time, talk to me first before deciding I’m the bad guy.”

Relief flooded me. I had been lucky—Jake was a true friend, and he was willing to put this behind us. That day, I learned a valuable lesson about trust and communication. Never assume the worst without hearing the full story. Misunderstandings can break even the strongest friendships if we let emotions take control. From that moment on, I promised myself that I would always seek the truth before jumping to conclusions.", ,  , ,"Adjective - Incorrect or inappropriate use of adjectives, such as using the wrong form (comparative, superlative): Incorrect: ""She is more prettier than her sister.""

He was the one person I could always count on, and I never thought anything could come between us. But one day, something happened that made me question our friendship.

I was walking past the school canteen when I heard laughter coming from a group of students. As I got closer, I recognised Jake’s voice among them. My heart sank when I heard my name being mentioned, followed by more laughter. My stomach twisted. Was he making fun of me? Was he telling jokes at my expense? A surge of anger and betrayal coursed through me.

Without waiting to hear more, I turned on my heel and walked away, my mind spinning. I felt humiliated and hurt. How could he, my best friend, talk about me behind my back? That evening, I could not shake the bitterness that filled me. The next day, I confronted him, my emotions bubbling over like a volcano about to erupt.

“How could you do that to me?” I snapped, my hands clenched into fists.

Jake looked confused. “What are you talking about?”

“Don’t play dumb! I heard you laughing about me with your new friends,” I accused, my voice rising.

His expression changed from confusion to hurt. “I wasn’t making fun of you,” he said, his tone defensive.

But I wasn’t in the mood to listen. Without giving him a chance to explain, I stormed off. Over the next few days, I ignored him completely. I avoided him in class, refused to respond to his texts, and even turned away when he tried to talk to me. I convinced myself that I was right to be angry.

It wasn’t until a few days later that I spoke to another friend about what had happened. He looked surprised and told me that I had completely misunderstood the situation. “Jake wasn’t making fun of you,” he said. “He was actually sharing a funny memory about the time you two got lost during last year’s school camp. Everyone was laughing because it was such a ridiculous story, not because they were mocking you.”

A cold wave of realisation washed over me. I had let my anger cloud my judgment. Instead of talking to Jake and finding out the truth, I had assumed the worst and shut him out. I had hurt someone who had always stood by me.

That evening, I mustered the courage to call him. As the phone rang, my heart pounded. What if he was still upset? What if I had ruined our friendship beyond repair?

When Jake picked up, I took a deep breath. “Jake, I’m so sorry,” I said, my voice trembling. “I should’ve trusted you instead of assuming the worst. I realise now that I jumped to conclusions without even giving you a chance to explain.”

There was a pause, and then he let out a small chuckle. “I was wondering when you’d come to your senses,” he said. “I was pretty hurt, you know. But I forgive you. Next time, talk to me first before deciding I’m the bad guy.”

Relief flooded me. I had been lucky—Jake was a true friend, and he was willing to put this behind us. That day, I learned a valuable lesson about trust and communication. Never assume the worst without hearing the full story. Misunderstandings can break even the strongest friendships if we let emotions take control.

167,English,Primary 6, ,"Guilt weighed heavily on me as I replayed the argument in my mind. It had all started with a simple misunderstanding, but it had caused a rift between me and my best friend.

Jake and I had been inseparable since childhood. We did everything together, from playing video games and riding our bicycles around the neighbourhood to staying up late talking about life. He was the one person I could always count on, and I never thought anything could come between us. But one day, something happened that made me question our friendship.

I was walking past the school canteen when I heard laughter coming from a group of students. As I got closer, I recognised Jake’s voice among them. My heart sank when I heard my name being mentioned, followed by more laughter. My stomach twisted. Was he making fun of me? Was he telling jokes at my expense? A surge of anger and betrayal coursed through me.

Without waiting to hear more, I turned on my heel and walked away, my mind spinning. I felt humiliated and hurt. How could he, my best friend, talk about me behind my back? That evening, I could not shake the bitterness that filled me. The next day, I confronted him, my emotions bubbling over like a volcano about to erupt.

“How could you do that to me?” I snapped, my hands clenched into fists.

Jake looked confused. “What are you talking about?”

“Don’t play dumb! I heard you laughing about me with your new friends,” I accused, my voice rising.

His expression changed from confusion to hurt. “I wasn’t making fun of you,” he said, his tone defensive.

But I wasn’t in the mood to listen. Without giving him a chance to explain, I stormed off. Over the next few days, I ignored him completely. I avoided him in class, refused to respond to his texts, and even turned away when he tried to talk to me. I convinced myself that I was right to be angry.

It wasn’t until a few days later that I spoke to another friend about what had happened. He looked surprised and told me that I had completely misunderstood the situation. “Jake wasn’t making fun of you,” he said. “He was actually sharing a funny memory about the time you two got lost during last year’s school camp. Everyone was laughing because it was such a ridiculous story, not because they were mocking you.”

A cold wave of realisation washed over me. I had let my anger cloud my judgment. Instead of talking to Jake and finding out the truth, I had assumed the worst and shut him out. I had hurt someone who had always stood by me.

That evening, I mustered the courage to call him. As the phone rang, my heart pounded. What if he was still upset? What if I had ruined our friendship beyond repair?

When Jake picked up, I took a deep breath. “Jake, I’m so sorry,” I said, my voice trembling. “I should’ve trusted you instead of assuming the worst. I realise now that I jumped to conclusions without even giving you a chance to explain.”

There was a pause, and then he let out a small chuckle. “I was wondering when you’d come to your senses,” he said. “I was pretty hurt, you know. But I forgive you. Next time, talk to me first before deciding I’m the bad guy.”

Relief flooded me. I had been lucky—Jake was a true friend, and he was willing to put this behind us. That day, I learned a valuable lesson about trust and communication. Never assume the worst without hearing the full story. Misunderstandings can break even the strongest friendships if we let emotions take control.

Their sharp teeth,strong bodies,and dark eyes made them look dangerous. Whenever I saw one, my stomach twisted, and I wanted to run in the other direction.\n\n One day, I decided I did not want to be afraid anymore. My bestfriend, Olivia, had a Dobermann puppy named Crunchy.\"" He is very friendly,\""Olivia said.\""Come and meet him.\""I felt nervous, but I agreed.\n\n That afternoon, as I stepped outside, I suddenly heard loud barking. I looked up and froze. A man was walking past with a large Dobermann on a lead. It fixed its sharp eyes on me and led out a deep,booming bark that echoed through the streets. My whole body tensed. My hands turned clammy , and my heart pounded against my chest.\n\n \""Stay calm...do not run...\""I told myself, but my legs trembled, ready to bolt. I gripped the hen of my shirt tightly, my mind racing. What if it chased me? What if it bit me? The dog took a step forward, ears perked. I swallowed hard, my breath coming in short, I panicked gasps.\n\n Then, I remembered why I was here. I had to face my fear. Slowly, I took a deep breath and stepped forward, my heart still beating a little too fast. The Dobermann sat calmly in front of me, its bark eyes watched me curiously. I hesitated, then stretched out my hand.\n\n The dog sniffed my fingers before pressing its cold, wet nose against my palm. A shaky smile spread across my face as I exhaled, the tension in my shoulders easing .\""You are not so scary after all,\""I whispered, stroking its sleek fur.\n\n A wave of warmth filled my chest. I had faced my fear, and it no longer controlled me.\n ","<div class=\""paragraph\"">Provide specific text replacement for students to improve the text.</div>", , ,"Adjective - Incorrect or inappropriate use of adjectives, such as using the wrong form (comparative, superlative): Incorrect: ""She is more prettier than her sister.""

211,English Language,Primary 5, ,"“Where has my parrot gone?” Amy, Dan’s older sister, exclaimed frantically. It was just after dinner and Amy had returned to her bedroom to feed her parrot only to find the cage open, empty and had a single red feather from her parrot inside it. “Oh no!” She thought, “My parents are not going to let me keep a pet ever again if I don’t find out who did it!” \n Instantaneously, she sprung into action to try and find out who did it. First, she thought that she might not have locked the cage properly due to her carelessness but recalled clearly that she did lock the cage. Then, she started looking around the cage to see if there were any clues left behind by the culprit. Meanwhile, her younger brother had heard her shout. Waves of anxiety swept through him as he was the one who had set the bird free as he was watching and feeding it without his sister’s permission. At the birdcage, Amy found a piece of cloth with red and white stripes on it that looked like it had been torn off a shirt. She pondered whether the cloth could have been torn off the culprit’s shirt when they freed the bird.\n However, she could not rule anyone out yet as everyone in the family all had red and white striped shirts to wear on national day and they all had tears on them due to various accidents that happened. Below the cage, she found a packet of half-empty bird seeds as if someone was feeding the parrot before it escaped and also an overturned stool. She thought that it might have been her brother as he was the only one who needed a stool to unlock the cage but realised that it could not be him as he did not have the key to unlock the cage. \n Amy then thought to check the security camera her parents had installed and noticed that there was a person standing near the cage at around 7 o'clock at night. She zoomed in on the figure and discovered that the person was short and standing near the cage. Although she could not see what he or she was doing, there was a loud squawk soon afterwards as the parrot escaped.\n Then, realisation dawned on Amy as she hurried to the place where she kept the keys and discovered the key was missing and there was only the spare key left. Realising her own brother had done it, she stormed up the stairs furiously and slammed open her brother’s bedroom door. When Amy opened the door, the waves of rage in her was palpable as she accused her brother indignantly, “I knew you let my parrot escape!” “I… I didn't do it!” Dan said shakily. “Yes you did! There was a piece of the cloth that you are wearing now and also a stool which you used to steal my keys!” Amy said angrily. “I am going to tell mom and dad!”\n The anxiety that coursed through Dan like a wave was palpable as he stuttered over his words. He did set the parrot free but only accidentally as he wanted to feed it at least once.\n In the end, Amy’s parents ordered Dan to pay back the money used to buy the parrot out of his own pocket money and apologize to Amy. She forgave him and decided to put this incident aside and let bygones be bygones.\n\n\n ", , , ,"Adjective - Incorrect or inappropriate use of adjectives, such as using the wrong form (comparative, superlative): Incorrect: ""She is more prettier than her sister.""

220,English Language,Primary 5, ,"“Where has my parrot gone?” Amy, Dan’s older sister, exclaimed frantically. It was just after dinner and Amy had returned to her bedroom to feed her parrot only to find the cage open, empty and had a single red feather from her parrot inside it. “Oh no!” She thought, “My parents are not going to let me keep a pet ever again if I don’t find out who did it!” \n Instantaneously, she sprung into action to try and find out who did it. First, she thought that she might not have locked the cage properly due to her carelessness but recalled clearly that she did lock the cage. Then, she started looking around the cage to see if there were any clues left behind by the culprit. Meanwhile, her younger brother had heard her shout. Waves of anxiety swept through him as he was the one who had set the bird free as he was watching and feeding it without his sister’s permission. At the birdcage, Amy found a piece of cloth with red and white stripes on it that looked like it had been torn off a shirt. She pondered whether the cloth could have been torn off the culprit’s shirt when they freed the bird.\n However, she could not rule anyone out yet as everyone in the family all had red and white striped shirts to wear on national day and they all had tears on them due to various accidents that happened. Below the cage, she found a packet of half-empty bird seeds as if someone was feeding the parrot before it escaped and also an overturned stool. She thought that it might have been her brother as he was the only one who needed a stool to unlock the cage but realised that it could not be him as he did not have the key to unlock the cage. \n Amy then thought to check the security camera her parents had installed and noticed that there was a person standing near the cage at around 7 o'clock at night. She zoomed in on the figure and discovered that the person was short and standing near the cage. Although she could not see what he or she was doing, there was a loud squawk soon afterwards as the parrot escaped.\n Then, realisation dawned on Amy as she hurried to the place where she kept the keys and discovered the key was missing and there was only the spare key left. Realising her own brother had done it, she stormed up the stairs furiously and slammed open her brother’s bedroom door. When Amy opened the door, the waves of rage in her was palpable as she accused her brother indignantly, “I knew you let my parrot escape!” “I… I didn't do it!” Dan said shakily. “Yes you did! There was a piece of the cloth that you are wearing now and also a stool which you used to steal my keys!” Amy said angrily. “I am going to tell mom and dad!”\n The anxiety that coursed through Dan like a wave was palpable as he stuttered over his words. He did set the parrot free but only accidentally as he wanted to feed it at least once.\n In the end, Amy’s parents ordered Dan to pay back the money used to buy the parrot out of his own pocket money and apologize to Amy. She forgave him and decided to put this incident aside and let bygones be bygones.\n\n\n ", , , ,"Adjective - Incorrect or inappropriate use of adjectives, such as using the wrong form (comparative, superlative): Incorrect: ""She is more prettier than her sister.""

321,Chinese,Secondary 2,竞争往往会给人带来前进的动力，然而最近发生的一件事，却让你明白恶性竞争会带来不良的结果。试描述这件事，并谈谈你从中得到的启示。,"我一直认为竞争是非常重要的，它能让我们变得更，取得更好的成绩。最近，我遇到了一次竞赛，它让我意识到恶性竞争有时也能带来不好的后果。 
 
 
有一天，我们班举行了一场英语比赛，很多同学都很紧张，因为这次比赛很重要，能影响到我们的成绩。我的同学小华非常历害，他总是考试得第一，大家都觉得他是最聪明的。我也很想超越他，赢得第一名。 
 
 
我开始拼命的复习，做了很多试题，甚至放弃了和朋友们一起玩的时间。可是，复习的时候，我开始变得不耐烦，看到小华做的题目总是很轻松，我就觉得自己不如他。于是，我开始不喜欢和他一起讨论问题，觉得他总是能轻松答对那些我做错的题目。我们之间的关戏变得越来越冷淡，我甚至开始怀义他是不是有什么不正当的手段。 
 
 
终于，竞赛来了。我紧张得不得了，手心里全是汗。虽然我尽力发挥，但最终还是没能超越小华。我很失望，觉得自己付出的努力没有得到回报。我看到小华得了第一名，虽然他看起来很开心，但我心里有种不太舒服的感觉，因为我觉得自己和他竞争时太过用力，失去了很多友谊和快乐。 
 
 
从这件事中，我意识到虽然竞争可以让我们变得更好，但过度的竞争有时会让我们失去更多东西，比如朋友之间的信任和关戏。如果我们只想着急败别人，而忽视了与他人合作和互相帮助的意义，那么这种竞争就变得没有意义，反而会带来不好的后果。以后我会更加主重和同学们一起合作，而不是只故着抄越别人。 我一直认为竞争是非常重要的，它能让我们变得更，取得更好的成绩。最近，我遇到了一次竞赛，它让我意识到恶性竞争有时也能带来不好的后果。有一天，我们班举行了一场英语比赛，很多同学都很紧张，因为这次比赛很重要，能影响到我们的成绩。我的同学小华非常历害，他总是考试得第一，大家都觉得他是最聪明的。我也很想超越他，赢得第一名。我开始拼命的复习，做了很多试题，甚至放弃了和朋友们一起玩的时间。可是，复习的时候，我开始变得不耐烦，看到小华做的题目总是很轻松，我就觉得自己不如他。于是，我开始不喜欢和他一起讨论问题，觉得他总是能轻松答对那些我做错的题目。我们之间的关戏变得越来越冷淡，我甚至开始怀义他是不是有什么不正当的手段。终于，竞赛来了。我紧张得不得了，手心里全是汗。虽然我尽力发挥，但最终还是没能超越小华。我很失望，觉得自己付出的努力没有得到回报。我看到小华得了第一名，虽然他看起来很开心，但我心里有种不太舒服的感觉，因为我觉得自己和他竞争时太过用力，失去了很多友谊和快乐。从这件事中，我意识到虽然竞争可以让我们变得更好，但过度的竞争有时会让我们失去更多东西，比如朋友之间的信任和关戏。如果我们只想着急败别人，而忽视了与他人合作和互相帮助的意义，那么这种竞争就变得没有意义，反而会带来不好的后果。以后我会更加主重和同学们一起合作，而不是只故着抄越别人。",,,"内容 - 5 - 内容不足，不切合题意。内容层次不清楚，没有条理或重复，甚至杂乱无章。, 内容 - 4 - 内容不太充实，不太切合题意。内容层次不太清楚，说明也不太详尽、不太有条理。, 内容 - 3 - 内容还算充实，还算切合题意。内容还算有层次，说明还算详尽、有条理。, 内容 - 2 - 内容相当充实，相当切合题意。内容相当有层次，说明相当详尽，也相当有条理。, 内容 - 1 - 内容充实，切合题意。内容有层次，说明详尽、有条理。, 语文与结构 - 5 - 语句不通顺，汉字的书写、词语、语法及标点符号的运用错误非常多。词汇贫乏，遣词造句错误多，表达不清楚。组织凌乱，没有衔接。, 语文与结构 - 4 - 语句不太通顺，汉字的书写、词语、及标点符号的运用错误多。词汇有限，句式简单，没有变化，表达不太清楚。组织不太得当，衔接不太紧凑，段落不太分明。, 语文与结构 - 3 - 语句还算通顺，汉字的书写、词语、语法及标点符号的运用有些错误。用词还算适当，句式简单，变化少，表达还算清楚。组织还算得当，衔接还算紧凑，段落还算分明。, 语文与结构 - 2 - 语句相当通顺，汉字的书写、词语、语法及标点符号的运用有一些小错误。用词适当，句式相当正确且有变化，表达相当清楚。组织相当得当，衔接相当紧凑，段落相当分明。, 语文与结构 - 1 - 语句通顺，汉字的书写、词语、语法及标点符号的运用绝大多数正确。如有错误，也是极小的。用词丰富适当，句式正确且多样化，表达清楚。组织得当，衔接紧凑，段落分明。",,,,,

It was an idyllic scene.\n“Danny!” someone yelled. It was Mother’s close friend. She was out walking with a baby in a pram.\n“Hi, Mrs. Deepak!” Danny shouted as he ran up the slope towards her. As she chatted with Danny, she rocked the pram gently to soothe the baby.\nSuddenly, my hackles rose with a tingling premonition. \n A little boy on a bicycle swerved past unsteadily and knocked Mrs. Deepak's arm. She lost her grip on the pram, and it went rolling down the slope with the baby still inside. I caught a glimpse of the look of horror on her face, as if it had been etched on white marble. My canine instincts had proven right. With a loud bark, I bounded forward, jerking the lead out of Danny's hands in that split second. The lead streamed behind me as I raced after the runaway pram. With an extra burst of energy, I shot level with the pram. Snapping my jaws over one side of the handlebar, I dug into the ground with my paws. The pram's momentum dragged me a little, but to my utmost relief, the wheels slowed, then halted entirely. \nMrs. Deepak rushed over, her trembling hands scooping the unharmed baby from the pram. Danny caught up, breathless, and clipped my lead back on. \""Good boy!\"" he panted, ruffling my fur. Mrs. Deepak thanked me with tearful eyes, and I wagged my tail—just another day in the life of a dog who’d finally earned his extra-large biscuit.\n To my utmost relief, it stopped safely. Surprisingly, the baby was gurgling. Running feet pounded up as Mrs. Deepak dashed to pick up her baby, Danny right on her heels. \""Oh, Danny! Your wonderful dog saved my baby!\"" Mrs. Deepak repeated, clasping the baby to her bosom. Later, I learned Danny had poured out his woes to her earlier. That was why she insisted on accompanying him home to speak to his mother about me. When Danny’s mother looked at me, I responded with a bark. Her eyes softened, and she agreed I deserved a second chance. I was allowed to stay! \n\nA week later, Mrs. Deepak gifted me a gnawing bone shaped like a pair of shoes to show her gratitude. It even tasted like shoes! My act of heroism paid off, and peace finally reigned in the household. \n\n\n ","<div class=\""paragraph\"">Provide subtle hints or clues without giving direct answers, allowing students to arrive at the correct answer on their own.</div>", ,"CONTENT – Level 1 – My composition is confusing with largely irrelevant ideas., CONTENT – Level 2 – My composition is mundane with a few relevant ideas which are mostly undeveloped., CONTENT – Level 3 – My composition is fairly interesting with generally relevant ideas which are sufficiently developed., CONTENT – Level 4 – My composition is interesting with relevant ideas which are well-developed., CONTENT – Level 5 – My composition is highly interesting with fully relevant ideas which are thoroughly developed., LANGUAGE AND ORGANISATION – Level 1 – My composition is confusing with largely irrelevant ideas., LANGUAGE AND ORGANISATION – Level 2 – My composition is mundane with a few relevant ideas which are mostly undeveloped., LANGUAGE AND ORGANISATION – Level 3 – My composition is fairly interesting with generally relevant ideas which are sufficiently developed., LANGUAGE AND ORGANISATION – Level 4 – My composition is interesting with relevant ideas which are well-developed., LANGUAGE AND ORGANISATION – Level 5 – My composition is highly interesting with fully relevant ideas which are thoroughly developed., \n",,,,,

That dog has to go. I'm sick and tired of it destroying the things in the\n house, especially the shoes!\""\n\""But...\"" Danny\nI tried to interject.\n\""No 'but'!\"" his mother stormed. Danny's mother had ranted and raved about this before. However, this time, I detected the steely tone in her voice. Before long, it spelt doom for me.\nSoon, I would be separated from Danny, my optimistic, fun-loving master whom I adored with all my doggy heart. Danny was protesting, tears glazing his eyes. His mother’s voice had now risen to fever pitch. What was I to do? I knew I had tried to behave. Well, except for one thing — I had the habit of chewing things.\n\n I flattened my body on the floor, laid my head on my paws and whined. I looked at him mournfully. My legs had turned into mush because of the fear that seized my heart.\n“I’m taking him for a walk,” Danny muttered, blinking away unshed tears.\nWalking beside Danny, birds flew free in the sky and chirped aloud their cheeky calls. It was an idyllic scene.\n“Danny!” someone yelled. It was Mother’s close friend. She was out walking with a baby in a pram.\n“Hi, Mrs. Deepak!” Danny shouted as he ran up the slope towards her. As she chatted with Danny, she rocked the pram gently to soothe the baby.\nSuddenly, my hackles rose with a tingling premonition. \n A little boy on a bicycle swerved past unsteadily and knocked Mrs. Deepak's arm. She lost her grip on the pram, and it went rolling down the slope with the baby still inside. I caught a glimpse of the look of horror on her face, as if it had been etched on white marble. My canine instincts had proven right. With a loud bark, I bounded forward, jerking the lead out of Danny's hands in that split second. The lead streamed behind me as I raced after the runaway pram. With an extra burst of energy, I shot level with the pram. Snapping my jaws over one side of the handlebar, I dug into the ground with my paws. The pram's momentum dragged me a little, but to my utmost relief, the wheels slowed, then halted entirely. \nMrs. Deepak rushed over, her trembling hands scooping the unharmed baby from the pram. Danny caught up, breathless, and clipped my lead back on. \""Good boy!\"" he panted, ruffling my fur. Mrs. Deepak thanked me with tearful eyes, and I wagged my tail—just another day in the life of a dog who’d finally earned his extra-large biscuit.\n To my utmost relief, it stopped safely. Surprisingly, the baby was gurgling. Running feet pounded up as Mrs. Deepak dashed to pick up her baby, Danny right on her heels. \""Oh, Danny! Your wonderful dog saved my baby!\"" Mrs. Deepak repeated, clasping the baby to her bosom. Later, I learned Danny had poured out his woes to her earlier. That was why she insisted on accompanying him home to speak to his mother about me. When Danny’s mother looked at me, I responded with a bark. Her eyes softened, and she agreed I deserved a second chance. I was allowed to stay! \n\nA week later, Mrs. Deepak gifted me a gnawing bone shaped like a pair of shoes to show her gratitude. It even tasted like shoes! My act of heroism paid off, and peace finally reigned in the household. \n\n\n ","<div class=\""paragraph\"">Provide subtle hints or clues without giving direct answers, allowing students to arrive at the correct answer on their own.</div>", ,"CONTENT – Level 1 – My composition is confusing with largely irrelevant ideas., CONTENT – Level 2 – My composition is mundane with a few relevant ideas which are mostly undeveloped., CONTENT – Level 3 – My composition is fairly interesting with generally relevant ideas which are sufficiently developed., CONTENT – Level 4 – My composition is interesting with relevant ideas which are well-developed., CONTENT – Level 5 – My composition is highly interesting with fully relevant ideas which are thoroughly developed., LANGUAGE AND ORGANISATION – Level 1 – My composition is confusing with largely irrelevant ideas., LANGUAGE AND ORGANISATION – Level 2 – My composition is mundane with a few relevant ideas which are mostly undeveloped., LANGUAGE AND ORGANISATION – Level 3 – My composition is fairly interesting with generally relevant ideas which are sufficiently developed., LANGUAGE AND ORGANISATION – Level 4 – My composition is interesting with relevant ideas which are well-developed., LANGUAGE AND ORGANISATION – Level 5 – My composition is highly interesting with fully relevant ideas which are thoroughly developed., \n",,,,,

The sky was an inky blue, and the streetlights cast long, flickering shadows on the pavement. My bag felt heavy on my shoulders, and the usually familiar walk home seemed eerily quiet. I was the last one to leave school, and the silence made my footsteps sound louder than usual.\nAs I turned down the narrow lane that led to my block, I suddenly heard it — footsteps. Slow. Deliberate. Just behind me.\nAt first, I thought it was my imagination. I quickened my pace slightly, and the footsteps did too. A chill ran down my spine. I dared not look back. My heart began to pound, and my breaths came faster.\n*Who could it be? Why were they following me?* \nI reached into my pocket for my phone, but my hands were trembling. The footsteps grew louder, quicker. I turned a sharp corner and broke into a run. My bag thumped against my back as I sprinted towards the main road, where I knew there would be people.\nThen I heard a voice behind me, breathless. “Wait! You dropped this!”\nI stopped in my tracks and spun around. A boy, around my age, was holding my water bottle. I had left it on the bench outside the school gate. His eyes widened in alarm, realizing he had frightened me.\n“I’m so sorry!” he said, holding up both hands in surrender. “I didn’t mean to scare you—I just wanted to return this.”\nRelief flooded through me, mixed with embarrassment. I took the bottle and mumbled a thank you, still catching my breath. The fear that had gripped me moments ago faded, replaced by laughter — nervous, but genuine.\nIt was a fearful encounter, yes — but also a reminder that sometimes, our minds can turn shadows into monsters.\n\n\n ","<div class=\""paragraph\"">Provide subtle hints or clues without giving direct answers, allowing students to arrive at the correct answer on their own.</div>","div class=\""paragraph\"">\n<p class=\""\"">The sky had already turned dark when I left the school gate. The usually busy road was quiet, and even the coffeeshop at the corner was closing. As I walked past the playground, I heard soft footsteps behind me. I stopped. The footsteps stopped too. I turned around quickly, but the path was empty.</p>\n<p class=\""\"">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\""\"">My heart pounded. I quickened my pace, clutching my bag tightly. The sound came again, louder this time. Was someone following me? I remembered the stories my friends had told about this area being haunted. Just then, a cat dashed across the road. I gasped.</p>\n<p class=\""\"">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\""\"">To my great relief, it was just a stray cat knocking over a rubbish bin. I laughed nervously at myself. Maybe I had watched too many horror movies.</p>\n</div>",,,,,,
