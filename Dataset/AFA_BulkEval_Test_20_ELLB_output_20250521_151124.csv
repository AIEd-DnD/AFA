"""See you tommorow!"" My teacher, Ms Lim exclaimed. Everyone rushed out of the classroom like a herd of Elephants. ""La, la, la"" I hummed a tune merrily as I walked back home. It was a seemingly peaceful afternoon. When came home, I was greated with an aroma of delicious food. After gobbling up my food, I immediately started reading a new book I got for my birthday. ""Yes! I think I got to the interesting part."" I thought. Right when I turned the page, I saw it marred with crayon scribbles! I knew my younger brother did it because he just got a new set of crayons. My face turned as red as any ku Kueh. I was furious! I stormmed into my brothers room and bellowed ""WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY BOOK!"" My brother hung his head in shame and muttered "" I... I... am sorry"" At that momment I could not control my emotions so I took his favourite Stuffed toy and ripped the head off. ""That is what you get for ruining my book!"" I said angryly. My brother burst out crying. I realised what I did and thought, ""I have to fix this or else mom will scold me."" I immediately ran to my friend's house, like a crazy mad horse on steroids. You may be thinking, why would I go to my friend, Amy? Well Amy is very good at sewing so, I wanted her to sew the head of the Stuffed toy back together with the body. ""Ding! Dong!"" I ringed the bell. When amy opened the door, I said, ""hI Amy, I need you to help me sew this stuffed toy back together as fast as possible."" She immediately took the toy and started sewing. I could not believe my eyes, she was so fast. After five minutes, everything was fixed. I thanked Amy profusely. She offered me to stay a bit longer but I really had to go back home. ""See you at school!"" Amy said. I came home panting, I was drenched in sweat. I realised that my mother was comforting my brother. When I walked into the room, I apologised. ""I am so sorry for not controlling my emotions, I went out to ask Amy to sew it back together."" My brother was very appy and jumped up and down. In a nutshell My mother was very Proud of me that I took responsibility to fix it back. The next time something like this happends, I will control my emotions. I was quite happy too, even though a page of my book was ruined and I did not control my emotions, I practiced to be responsible and I dit not get scolded by my mother.","<tag id=""1"">""See you tommorow!""</tag> My teacher, Ms Lim exclaimed.

"""See you tommorow!"" My teacher, Ms Lim exclaimed. Everyone rushed out of the classroom like a herd of Elephants. ""La, la, la"" I hummed a tune merrily as I walked back home.

"""See you tommorow!"" My teacher, Ms Lim exclaimed. Everyone rushed out of the classroom like a herd of Elephants. ""La, la, la"" I hummed a tune merrily as I walked back home. It was a seemingly peaceful afternoon. When came home, I was greated with an aroma of delicious food. After gobbling up my food, I immediately started reading a new book I got for my birthday. ""Yes! I think I got to the interesting part."" I thought. Right when I turned the page, I saw it marred with crayon scribbles! I knew my younger brother did it because he just got a new set of crayons. My face turned as red as any ku Kueh. I was furious! I stormmed into my brothers room and bellowed ""WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY BOOK!"" My brother hung his head in shame and muttered "" I... I... am sorry"" At that momment I could not control my emotions so I took his favourite Stuffed toy and ripped the head off. ""That is what you get for ruining my book!"" I said angryly. My brother burst out crying. I realised what I did and thought, ""I have to fix this or else mom will scold me."" I immediately ran to my friend's house, like a crazy mad horse on steroids. You may be thinking, why would I go to my friend, Amy? Well Amy is very good at sewing so, I wanted her to sew the head of the Stuffed toy back together with the body. ""Ding! Dong!"" I ringed the bell. When amy opened the door, I said, ""hI Amy, I need you to help me sew this stuffed toy back together as fast as possible."" She immediately took the toy and started sewing. I could not believe my eyes, she was so fast. After five minutes, everything was fixed. I thanked Amy profusely. She offered me to stay a bit longer but I really had to go back home. ""See you at school!"" Amy said. I came home panting, I was drenched in sweat. I realised that my mother was comforting my brother. When I walked into the room, I apologised. ""I am so sorry for not controlling my emotions, I went out to ask Amy to sew it back together."" My brother was very appy and jumped up and down. In a nutshell My mother was very Proud of me that I took responsibility to fix it back. The next time something like this happends, I will control my emotions. I was quite happy too, even though a page of my book was ruined and I did not control my emotions, I practiced to be responsible and I dit not get scolded by my mother.","<tag id=""1"">""See you tommorow!""</tag> My teacher, Ms Lim exclaimed.

"The sun's brilliant rays illuminated the morning sky. Plumes of bluish white clounds floated in a tranquil procession. It was a bright and beautiful day. I was coming home from my last day of school. I was so excited and jumped around. The school holiday had started. My parents had not planned anything for the holiday. When I was at home, I heard my parents in the room talking about where to go for the school holiday. I was shocked to see my room filled with suitcase which was packed. I knew immediately we were leaving the house for a holiday. My parents told me that we were going to malaysia. My adrenaline started pumping when I heard them say it. My parents and I immediately packed up and boarded our bus to go to malaysia. When we were at the malaysia immigration. We saw about thousands of people queuing. My parents and I queued at the shortest lane but to make problem worst the officer who was checking the passport went for a breaktime. I knew it be long wait. After an hour, the line started moving. Slowly but surely we were getting closer to the counter but it suddenly stopped. My parents saw. the sign on the board and told me that the computer in the office had broken down. I was frustrated but waited patiently. After three hours, my parents and I had crossed the counter. After waiting for a long time in the queue, my parents and I had a rest and had our dinner. I heaved sigh of relief that we were not still stuck there for far too long. My parents and I continued our journey to malaysia. At malaysia there was a lot of queues my parents and I had waited for nearly an hour but we learned something.

"The sun's brilliant rays illuminated the morning sky. Plumes of bluish white clounds floated in a tranquil procession. It was a bright and beautiful day. I was coming home from my last day of school. I was so excited and jumped around. The school holiday had started. My parents had not planned anything for the holiday. When I was at home, I heard my parents in the room talking about where to go for the school holiday. I was shocked to see my room filled with suitcase which was packed. I knew immediately we were leaving the house for a holiday. My parents told me that we were going to malaysia. My adrenaline started pumping when I heard them say it. My parents and I immediately packed up and boarded our bus to go to malaysia. When we were at the malaysia immigration. We saw about thousands of people queuing. My parents and I queued at the shortest lane but to make problem worst the officer who was checking the passport went for a breaktime. I knew it be long wait. After an hour, the line started moving. Slowly but surely we were getting closer to the counter but it suddenly stopped. My parents saw. the sign on the board and told me that the computer in the office had broken down. I was frustrated but waited patiently. After three hours, my parents and I had crossed the counter. After waiting for a long time in the queue, my parents and I had a rest and had our dinner. I heaved sigh of relief that we were not still stuck there for far too long. My parents and I continued our journey to malaysia. At malaysia there was a lot of queues my parents and I had waited for nearly an hour but we learned something.
