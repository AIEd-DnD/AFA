3,English,Primary 6, ,"Annoyed and angry. That was what I felt before learning that my best friend had an accident and was in the hospital. ""Finally! Today is the day to meet up with Parker!"" I shouted with joy as I beamed from ear to ear. Parker and I were bossom buddies. We have been through thick and thin together and were as close as a hand and a glove. Our bond was unbreakable, until Parker had to leave and go to America. We both had set a date to meet up a few months later. His family was coming back to France, and so was he! We agreed to meet up at my parents restaurant. However, I had a long wait. Parker Bruno was late. He was never late, he was the most puntural person I knew. I then decided to call him after an hour. But he did not pick up, so I gave him a voice mail. ""Parker! Where in the world are you? I have waited for an hour but you never appeared! Please don't tell me that you had forgotten our promise and bailed!"" I said with anger boiling in me, as I drank my drink and sat at the table. Just then, Parker's mother called. ""Michael!"" she said. Mrs Bruno was crying. ""Michael! Parker is in the hospital, he had an accident on the way to your familys restaurant,"" she sobbed. I stood rooted to the ground, shocked. My anger dispersed quickly as I pry the details from Mrs Bruno. ""What! Parker was in an accident? Oh, I told him to be careful as he was driving in the wee hours! Which hospital is he in? I will go there now,"" I said. ""He is at the France International Hospital."" Mrs Bruno said. Without a second thought, I got into my car and rushed to the hospital. As I got out of my car, I saw Mrs Bruno waiting outside. We both quickly went up to Parker's ward. As I opened the door, strings of confetti rained on me. I was in utter shock! There stood Parker, all safe and sound. ""Parker! I thought you were in an accident!"" I shouted, clearly annoyed. ""Hello to you to Michael. I was not, however, in an accident. Do you remember our promise that we made?"" Parker said with a sly smile. Just then, it all dawned to me when I recalled. ""Michael! Lets make a promise. After a few months, we will meet up and I promised you that you will chase after me!"" Parker, a few months ago said. Tears blurred my vision as I send him of at the airport. Until now, he is still as sly as a fox. I smiled adoringly and gathered him into a hug. ""I missed you,"" I said lovingly. ""I miss you to,"" he replied. That long wait I had to experience was worth it. Today is 20th of July that I will remember forever.", , , ,"Add: Conjunction -  Omission of conjunctions to link sentences or clauses: Incorrect: ""He didn't study he failed the exam."" Correct: ""He didn't study, so he failed the exam."" (A conjunction is needed to show the cause-effect relationship), 

Add: Determiner - Omission of determiners, such as articles, quantifiers, and possessive determiners:Incorrect: ""She bought apple and orange."" Correct: ""She bought an apple and an orange."" (Articles ""an"" are needed for singular nouns), 

Add: Particle - Omission of particles, especially in phrasal verbs: Incorrect: ""She looked up the dictionary."" Correct: ""She looked up the word in the dictionary."" (The object placement in the phrasal verb is incorrect),

Add: Preposition - Omission of prepositions, leading to grammatical errors: Incorrect: ""She is good math."" Correct: ""She is good at math."" (""Good at"" is the correct prepositional phrase in this context),

Add: Punctuation - Punctuation - Incorrect or missing punctuation marks that change the meaning: Incorrect: ""Let's eat grandma."" Correct: ""Let's eat, grandma."" (The comma clarifies that the speaker is addressing ""grandma"" rather than suggesting cannibalism)

Add: Contraction - Omission of contractions, leading to confusion: Incorrect: ""Its raining today."" Correct: ""Its raining today."" (""Its"" is possessive, while ""it's"" is the contraction for ""it is""),

Add: Possessive - Incorrect use of possessive forms ('s or s'): Incorrect: ""The dogs bone was lost."" Correct: ""The dog's bone was lost."" (""Dog's"" shows possession correctly),

Remove: Conjunction - Incorrect use of conjunctions to link sentences or clauses: Incorrect: ""Although it was cold outside, but I still went for a walk."" Correct: ""Although it was cold outside, I still went for a walk."" ('Although' and 'but' are redundant together.),

Remove: Determiner - Incorrect use of determiners, such as articles, quantifiers, and possessive determiners: Incorrect: ""I love the nature."" Correct: ""I love nature."" (""Nature"" is uncountable and does not typically take the definite article ""the""),

Remove: Possessive - Incorrect use of possessive forms ('s or s'): Incorrect: ""The dog wagged it's tail."" Correct: ""The dog wagged its tail."" (""Its"" is the possessive form, while ""it's"" is the contraction for ""it is"");

Remove: Space - Missing or extra spaces between words or punctuation: Incorrect: ""I went tothe park."" Correct: ""I went to the park."" (A missing space between ""to"" and ""the""),

Replace: Adjective - Incorrect or inappropriate use of adjectives, such as using the wrong form (comparative, superlative): Incorrect: ""She is more prettier than her sister."" Correct: ""She is prettier than her sister."" (""More"" is unnecessary because ""prettier"" is already in its comparative form); Incorrect: ""He is a very sensible player."" Correct: ""He is a very sensitive player."" (""Sensitive"" is the appropriate term depending on context),

Replace: Adverb - Incorrect use of adverbs, such as using an adjective instead of an adverb: Incorrect: ""He runs quick."" Correct: ""He runs quickly."" (""Quick"" is an adjective, but ""quickly"" is the correct adverb form to describe the verb ""runs""),

Replace: Conjunction - Incorrect use of conjunctions to link sentences or clauses: Incorrect: ""She is intelligent or beautiful."" Correct: ""She is intelligent and beautiful."" (""Or"" implies a choice, which isn't appropriate here),

Replace: Determiner - Incorrect use of determiners, such as articles, quantifiers, and possessive determiners: Incorrect: ""I need few help with this problem."" Correct: ""I need a little help with this problem."" (""A little"" is the correct quantifier for uncountable nouns like ""help"");

Replace: Noun - Incorrect noun forms, including pluralization or uncountable nouns: Incorrect: ""I have many homeworks."" Correct: ""I have a lot of homework."" (""Homework"" is uncountable and cannot take a plural form),

Replace: Particle - Incorrect use of particles, especially in phrasal verbs: Incorrect: ""Nearly 50 percent of adults fall under this category."" Correct: ""Nearly 50 percent of adults fall into this category."" (""Fall into"" is the correct phrasal verb to describe categorization),

Replace: Preposition - Incorrect prepositions, leading to grammatical errors: Incorrect: ""She is good in math."" Correct: ""She is good at math."" (""Good at"" is the correct prepositional phrase in this context),

Replace: Pronoun - Incorrect pronoun usage, including unclear references or agreement issues: Incorrect: ""Each student must bring their book."" Correct: ""Each student must bring his or her book."" (""His or her"" agrees with the singular subject ""student""),

Replace: Capitalisation - Incorrect use of uppercase and lowercase letters, especially for proper nouns and sentence beginnings: Incorrect: ""i went to paris last summer."" Correct: ""I went to Paris last summer."" (Proper nouns like ""Paris"" and sentence beginnings require capitalization),

Replace: Word/Phrase - Miscellaneous errors that don't fit other categories: Incorrect: ""I enjoy to the fullest life."" Correct: ""I enjoy life to the fullest."" (Reordering the sentence is necessary for natural phrasing),

Replace: Spelling - Incorrect spelling of words, affecting comprehension: Incorrect: ""She recieved a letter."" Correct: ""She received a letter."" (""Received"" is the correct spelling),

Replace: Word Order - Incorrect word order, making sentences sound unnatural or confusing: Incorrect: ""She always is late."" Correct: ""She is always late."" (""Always"" should come after the verb ""is""),

Replace: Verb Form - Incorrect verb form (including gerunds/infinitives): Incorrect: ""I look forward to meet you."" Correct: ""I look forward to meeting you."" (""Meeting"" is the correct gerund form after ""look forward to""),

Replace: Subject-Verb Agreement - Incorrect verb agreement: Incorrect: ""She have a car."" Correct: ""She has a car."" (""Have"" does not agree with the singular subject ""She""),

Collocation: Suggestion - Incorrect pairing of words that do not naturally go together in English: Incorrect: ""She made a big effort."" Correct: ""She made a great effort."" (""Great"" collocates naturally with ""effort"" in English)

Sentence: Fragment - Errors related to sentence structure, such as fragments or run-ons: Incorrect: ""When I arrived. I saw him."" Correct: ""When I arrived, I saw him."" (A dependent clause cannot stand alone as a sentence)","{'annotated_response': 'Annoyed and angry.
