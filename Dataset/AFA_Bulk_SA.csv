Scenario: You were walking home alone after your CCA ended late. Suddenly, you heard footsteps behind you…

Instructions:
Write a short paragraph describing the fearful encounter. Include:

What you saw, heard, or felt
How you reacted
How the situation ended

Tips:

Build suspense with short sentences.

I was the last one to leave school, and the silence made my footsteps sound louder than usual.\nAs I turned down the narrow lane that led to my block, I suddenly heard it — footsteps. Slow. Deliberate. Just behind me.\nAt first, I thought it was my imagination. I quickened my pace slightly, and the footsteps did too. A chill ran down my spine. I dared not look back. My heart began to pound, and my breaths came faster.\n*Who could it be? Why were they following me?* \nI reached into my pocket for my phone, but my hands were trembling. The footsteps grew louder, quicker. I turned a sharp corner and broke into a run. My bag thumped against my back as I sprinted towards the main road, where I knew there would be people.\nThen I heard a voice behind me, breathless. “Wait! You dropped this!”\nI stopped in my tracks and spun around. A boy, around my age, was holding my water bottle. I had left it on the bench outside the school gate. His eyes widened in alarm, realizing he had frightened me.\n“I’m so sorry!” he said, holding up both hands in surrender. “I didn’t mean to scare you—I just wanted to return this.”\nRelief flooded through me, mixed with embarrassment. I took the bottle and mumbled a thank you, still catching my breath.

Scenario: You were walking home alone after your CCA ended late. Suddenly, you heard footsteps behind you…

Instructions:
Write a short paragraph describing the fearful encounter. Include:
What led up to the moment
What you saw, heard, or felt
How you reacted
How the situation ended

Tips:

Build suspense with short sentences.
Use sensory details (e.g. footsteps, shadows, cold wind).
Show your emotions clearly.","**A Fearful Encounter**\nIt was already past 8 p.m. when my CCA finally ended.
