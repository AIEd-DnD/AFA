1,English,Primary 5, ,"""See you tommorow!"" My teacher, Ms Lim exclaimed. Everyone rushed out of the classroom like a herd of Elephants. ""La, la, la"" I hummed a tune merrily as I walked back home. It was a seemingly peaceful afternoon. When came home, I was greated with an aroma of delicious food. After gobbling up my food, I immediately started reading a new book I got for my birthday. ""Yes! I think I got to the interesting part."" I thought. Right when I turned the page, I saw it marred with crayon scribbles! I knew my younger brother did it because he just got a new set of crayons. My face turned as red as any ku Kueh. I was furious! I stormmed into my brothers room and bellowed ""WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY BOOK!"" My brother hung his head in shame and muttered "" I... I... am sorry"" At that momment I could not control my emotions so I took his favourite Stuffed toy and ripped the head off. ""That is what you get for ruining my book!"" I said angryly. My brother burst out crying. I realised what I did and thought, ""I have to fix this or else mom will scold me."" I immediately ran to my friend's house, like a crazy mad horse on steroids. You may be thinking, why would I go to my friend, Amy? Well Amy is very good at sewing so, I wanted her to sew the head of the Stuffed toy back together with the body. ""Ding! Dong!"" I ringed the bell. When amy opened the door, I said, ""hI Amy, I need you to help me sew this stuffed toy back together as fast as possible."" She immediately took the toy and started sewing. I could not believe my eyes, she was so fast.After five minutes, everything was fixed. I thanked Amy profusely. She offered me to stay a bit longer but I really had to go back home. ""See you at school!"" Amy said. I came home panting, I was drenched in sweat. I realised that my mother was comforting my brother. When I walked into the room, I apologised. ""I am so sorry for not controlling my emotions, I went out to ask Amy to sew it back together."" My brother was very appy and jumped up and down. In a nutshell My mother was very Proud of me that I took responsibility to fix it back. The next time something like this happends, I will control my emotions. I was quite happy too, even though a page of my book was ruined and I did not control my emotions, I practiced to be responsible and I dit not get scolded by my mother.", , , ,"Add: Conjunction -  Omission of conjunctions to link sentences or clauses: Incorrect: ""He didn't study he failed the exam.""

2,English,Secondary 2,,"Homework is something most students dread and claim to be a waste of time and hence, this brought about many contrasting views towards homework being a waste of time. while some people think that homework is a waste of time, I think that home work is actually useful for students. Therefore, I disagree that homework is a waste of time. Firstly, homework acts as a mini test or a revision of a topic you did. So although you might think that you learnt everything you need to learn in school, homework actually tests your application skills. In other words, homework test how you can use what you have learnt to answer questions. Therefore, homeworks can act as a mini test not only to test your knowledge of the topic, but also to test how you answer the topic. Secondly, especially for subjects like mathematics, homework can also act as a practice . Mathematics is a subject that many require practice as the more you practice, the more you get to familiarise the question types that might be tested for an exam. In addition, you do not have to mark your  work yourself and if you are unsure of a question or got something wrong , the teacher would be able to go through the homework with the whole class. Thus, I think that homework can act as a practice for students. Lastly, I think that homework works as good revision notes to refer to for example, with the past worksheets or homework you did, you can take note of the questions you got incorrect and memorise the corrections or how to avoid that mistake. Therefore, worksheets can work as a helpful last-minute revision tool. In a nutshell, homework is a very useful learning tool that can play a part in how well you do in an exam. Although only doing homework is not enough to secure your results, I hope that people would start taking homework more seriously as it could play a huge role in you doing well for your examinations.",,,,"Add: Conjunction -  Omission of conjunctions to link sentences or clauses: Incorrect: ""He didn't study he failed the exam.""

Homework is an essential tool in our lives, and many people get pressured and stressed by the overload of homework that they receive from their teachers <tag id=""1"">over days</tag><tag id=""2""> </tag>some even going to the extent of crying. Homework was invented in 1905 by Robert Nevilin and is still very much present in today\'s modern schools. In my opinion, homework can be very useful to us and I do not agree with this statement. Many people complain that homework is useless. To begin with, homework is useful as it helps students learn to manage their time properly. Homework allows students to plan their time, so that they have sufficient time to study, do their homework, and also for leisure. The students will be able to learn how to put their homework as their first priority so that in the future, when they are working, they will be efficient and fast. However, there are also downsides to having homework. One may feel too stressed from keeping up<tag id=""3""> </tag>deadlines and may not be able to cope with the enormous stress that they gain from it. Furthermore, homework can also help to improve one\'s grades<tag id=""4"">,</tag> it can motivate students to continue studying and may even teach them a thing or two. In 2020, <tag id=""5"">a research</tag> was conducted by Oxford University. They found out that 95% of students who consistently do their homework, do extraordinarily well in grades compared to students who are lazy and refuse to do their homework. In addition, homework <tag id=""6"">also is</tag> a good way <tag id=""7"">for revision</tag>. You can refer to it anytime you want <tag id=""8"">one</tag> it has been marked and if there is any <tag id=""9"">questions</tag> that needs to be clarified or<tag id=""10"">,</tag> one may get      wrong<tag id=""11""> </tag>they can always ask the teacher how to solve the problem. <tag id=""12"">Whatever</tag><tag id=""13""> </tag>homework students may not be able to do well in their studies and might not be motivated for school. Finally, homework is not a waste of time as without homework, many people will not be able to check if they are doing well in their studies or not. Homework helps to improve one\'s knowledge on the topic that they are doing and allows one to get better at it. If they are getting all the questions in the homework wrong, they will know which areas require <tag id=""14"">improvements</tag>. <tag id=""15"">From</tag> doing this, their grades will also improve and the students will be scoring higher marks <tag id=""16"">compared to the homework as did not exist</tag>. Many people make the argument that people will have to sleep late if there is homework. However, if one has enough discipline and integrity, <tag id=""17"">they</tag> will be able to finish <tag id=""18"">their</tag> homework <tag id=""19"">in</tag> time and be able to sleep early. In conclusion, homework is not a waste of time<tag id=""20""> </tag>and it is very essential and useful in a student\'s life.
